Genetic algorithms are optimization search algorithms that maximize or minimizes given functions. Indentifying the appropriate selection technique is a critical step in genetic algorithm. The process of selection plays an important role in resolving premature convergence because it occurs due to lack of diversity in the population. Therefore selection of population in each generation is very important. In this study, we have reported the significant work conducted on various selection techniques and the comparison of selection techniques.\n\n**Published in:** [2015 International Conference on Futuristic Trends on Computational Analysis and Knowledge Management (ABLAZE)](/xpl/conhome/7145339/proceeding)\n\n**Date of Conference:** 25-27 February 2015\n\n**Date Added to IEEE _Xplore_:** 13 July 2015\n\n**ISBN Information:**\n\n**DOI:** [10.1109/ABLAZE.2015.7154916](https://doi.org/10.1109/ABLAZE.2015.7154916)\n\nPublisher: IEEE\n\n**Conference Location:** Greater Noida, India\n\n![](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/assets/img/document/toc-icon.png) Contents\n\n* * *\n\n### I. Introduction\n\nThe focus of this paper is towards comparative analysis of different selection techniques used in genetic algorithms (GAs). GAs are \u201cadaptive heuristic search algorithms\u201d that are designed to mimic Darwin's principle of \u201csurvival of the fittest\u201d \\[22\\]. Which includes the following approach: individuals within a population compete for resources and the individuals that are most successful in the competition will produce offspring instead of those who didn't get success. Genes are transmitted over generations where pair of individuals get selected to produce better results/offspring in next generations \\[17\\]. Therefore, the individual that emerges out at the end is the fittest and more dominating than the weaker ones.\n\nFig. 1.\n\nSteps involved in simple genetic algorithm \\[16\\]\n\n[Sign in to Continue Reading](javascript:void())\n\nAuthors\n\nFigures\n\nReferences\n\nCitations\n\nKeywords\n\nMetrics\n\nMore Like This\n\n[Equal-Width Partitioning Roulette Wheel Selection in Genetic Algorithm](/document/6395007/)\n\n2012 Conference on Technologies and Applications of Artificial Intelligence\n\nPublished: 2012\n\n[Improved Roulette Wheel Selection-Based Genetic Algorithm for TSP](/document/7945968/)\n\n2016 International Conference on Network and Information Systems for Computers (ICNISC)\n\nPublished: 2016\n\n[Show More](javascript:void())\n\n**References is not available for this document.**\n\n### IEEE Account\n\n- [Change Username/Password](https://www.ieee.org/profile/changeusrpwd/showChangeUsrPwdPage.html?refSite=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org&refSiteName=IEEE Xplore)\n- [Update Address](https://www.ieee.org/profile/address/getAddrInfoPage.html?refSite=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org&refSiteName=IEEE Xplore)\n\n### Purchase Details\n\n- [Payment Options](https://www.ieee.org/profile/payment/showPaymentHome.html?refSite=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org&refSiteName=IEEE Xplore)\n- [Order History](https://www.ieee.org/profile/vieworder/showOrderHistory.html?refSite=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org&refSiteName=IEEE Xplore)\n- [View Purchased Documents](/articleSale/purchaseHistory.jsp)\n\n### Profile Information\n\n- [Communications Preferences](https://www.ieee.org/ieee-privacyportal/app/ibp?refSite=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org&refSiteName=IEEE Xplore)\n- [Profession and Education](https://www.ieee.org/profile/profedu/getProfEduInformation.html?refSite=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org&refSiteName=IEEE Xplore)\n- [Technical Interests](https://www.ieee.org/profile/tips/getTipsInfo.html?refSite=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org&refSiteName=IEEE Xplore)\n\n### Need Help?\n\n- **US & Canada:** +1 800 678 4333\n- **Worldwide:** +1 732 981 0060\n\n- [Contact & Support](/xpl/contact)\n\n- [About IEEE _Xplore_](/Xplorehelp/overview-of-ieee-xplore/about-ieee-xplore)\n- [Contact Us](/xpl/contact)\n- [Help](/Xplorehelp)\n- [Accessibility](/Xplorehelp/overview-of-ieee-xplore/accessibility-statement)\n- [Terms of Use](/Xplorehelp/overview-of-ieee-xplore/terms-of-use)\n- [Nondiscrimination Policy](http://www.ieee.org/web/aboutus/whatis/policies/p9-26.html)\n- [Sitemap](/xpl/sitemap.jsp)\n- [Privacy & Opting Out of Cookies](http://www.ieee.org/about/help/security_privacy.html)\n\nA not-for-profit organization, IEEE is the world's largest technical professional organization dedicated to advancing technology for the benefit of humanity.\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2024 IEEE - All rights reserved.

Genetic Algorithm belongs to the set of nature inspired algorithms. The applications of GA cover wide domains such as optimization, pattern recognition, learning, scheduling, economics, bioinformatics, etc. Fitness function is the measure of GA, distributed randomly in the population. Typically, the particular value for each gene start dominating as the search evolves. During the evolutionary search, fitness decreases as the population converges, this leads to the problems of the premature convergence and slow finishing. In this paper, a detailed and comprehensive survey of different approaches implemented to prevent premature convergence with their strengths and weaknesses is presented. This paper also discusses the details about GA, factors affecting the performance during the search for global optima and brief details about the theoretical framework of Genetic algorithm. The surveyed research is organized in a systematic order. A detailed summary and analysis of reviewed literature are given for the quick review. A comparison of reviewed literature has been made based on different parameters. The underlying motivation for this paper is to identify methods that allow the development of new strategies to prevent premature convergence and the effective utilization of genetic algorithms in the different area of research.\n\n## Graphical abstract\n\n![](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S1568494614003901-fx1.jpg)\n\n1.

Genetic Algorithms are one of the most popular algorithms in the categories of evolutionary algorithms. The basic principles of GAs were initially developed by Holland \\[1\\] and further carried by De Jong and Goldberg. Goldberg and Michalewicz have given the detailed overview and implementation of GAs in various fields \\[2\\], \\[3\\].\n\nGA operates on a population of solutions represented by some encoding. During the implementation process of GAs every solution or individual is assigned a fitness which is the measure of GAs. The fitness of each individual is directly related to the objective function for optimization problem \\[4\\]. Then, using the reproduction, crossover and mutation operators the individual population can be modified to a new population \\[5\\].\n\nIn GAs, the searching is iteratively guided by the fitness of the current parent generation. Whenever, we apply GAs for an optimization problem, it runs over thousands of individual, each represents a solution. The obtained solutions are evaluated and recombined to get offspring. It has been proven in \\[1\\], \\[2\\], \\[3\\], \\[6\\] that the previous generations details are only implicitly and partially preserved in the current generation. Hence, the regeneration can be hard to manage because of the following reasons:\n\n- (a)\nIn regeneration an individual population appears that had already been seen in the search space.\n\n- (b)\nGenetic drift can affect the search for optimization in a wrong direction.\n\n- (c)\nAs a result, a big part of the search space is left unexplored for the global optimum.\n\n\nGAs has gained popularity because it can be applied in a wide range of problems, including multimodal function optimization, machine learning, pattern recognition, image processing, natural language processing, grammar inference \\[4\\], \\[5\\], \\[8\\] and many more. But the behaviors of GAs have not been found as adaptive as expected. A common problem is that of premature convergence \\[7\\].\n\nThe primary interest of this paper is to show the detailed survey of different approaches proposed and applied for solving the premature convergence problem in GAs.\n\nSection 2 offers a detailed description of different factors affecting GA search. In this section we discussed diversity of population and selective pressure. The aim of Section 3 is to provide the theoretical framework to understand the genetic mechanism of evolutionary search process. This section briefly describes various theories such as Schema theory, Markov chain theory, and Statistical mechanism. This section also discusses and presents the important literatures to understand the genetic dynamics through Markov chain and statistical mechanics. The major parts of this paper contained in Section 4. This section gives the detailed and comprehensive survey on approaches of handling premature convergence within GAs. In addition, strengths and weaknesses have been provided for each approach. The surveyed research works have been organized according to the publication. Surveyed researches have been summarized in Section 5 using various parameters. The conclusions are drawn in Section 6. Lastly, references are given which covers the important literatures in the area of GA.\n\n## Section snippets\n\n## Factors affecting GAs\n\nA genetic algorithm is a method of optimization based on Darwin's natural selection theory. Darwin's theory was based on survival of the fittest to refine a set of solution in an iterative manner \\[2\\]. Darwin's theory says that evolution occurs if and only if three conditions met \\[9\\] (see Fig. 1). The conditions shown in Fig. 1 are necessary; it means that if due to any reason any one condition does not meet in the regeneration process, natural selection will cease at that generation.\n\nGA starts\n\n## Theoretical framework\n\nThis section provides an overview of different theories presented to address theoretical concerns related to evolutionary theory. There are various tools and methods available such as Schema theory, Markov chain theory, Dimensional analysis, Order statistics, Quantitative genetics, Orthogonal functional analysis, Quadratical dynamical systems, and Statistical physics. We have concentrated our study on three methods, namely Schema theory since it is considered as the fundamental theory, Markov\n\n## Approaches for preventing premature convergence\n\nThis section gives the detailed explanation of the different approaches given by researchers for managing the risk of premature convergence in GAs. We have reviewed various literatures and presenting twenty-four approaches with their strengths and weakness.\n\n## Summary and analyses of reviewed literatures\n\nIn this section we have furnished the summary of reviewed literatures and presented in tabulated form for quick review. Table 3 shows the details about the techniques applied in each approach. Table 4, Table 5 show the comparative analysis based on various parameters. Using these tables one can easily and quickly get the answer of questions such as: how diversity management was applied, how the recombination techniques was applied, how to measure the similarity of an individual, what are the\n\n## Conclusions\n\nIn this paper, we have reported the different factors which can affect the working of genetic algorithms. At the early stage of the paper we have discussed the effect of population diversity and selective pressure. In addition, we have given theoretical framework for GA which covers a brief description of three important theories, namely Schema theory, Markov chain theory and Statistical theory and their applicability have been shown by providing important literatures.\n\nThe main contribution of\n\n**Hari Mohan Pandey** obtained M.Tech degree in Computer Engineering from Mukesh Patel School of Technology Management & Engineering.

Local optimization schemes based on Newton or quasi-Newton updates cannot tread this fine balance. A similar limitation also applies to many derivative-free global evolutionary searches that typically end up with slower convergence. Notwithstanding a relatively rapid convergence around a local optimum, schemes using classical gradients require that the objective function be smooth. Thus, applied to real-world scenarios, these algorithms face challenges such as non-smoothness including discontinuities in the objective function and costly evaluations of gradients or Hessians, whenever possible. Based on a novel stochastic projection to estimate inverse Hessians, this work aims at generalizing a fast Newton-type local search whilst retaining capabilities of noise-assisted exploration in non-convex optimization. In principle, such a meeting of the best of both worlds in optimization should provide for a powerful paradigm shift, offering a versatile and robust tool for solving complex identification and variational problems arising in nonlinear mechanics of solids. The approach is well-suited even for cases where the objective function is implicitly defined and not amenable to explicit evaluation. In a first implementation of our proposal, we assess its performance against a few benchmark non-convex problems. Finally, we solve a parameter estimation problem for an isotropic and incompressible hyperelastic material.\n\n- ### [Efficient Pareto based approach for IoT task offloading on Fog\u2013Cloud environments](/science/article/pii/S254266052400252X)\n\n\n\n2024, Internet of Things (Netherlands)\n\n\n\nShow abstract\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn recent times, a new paradigm has emerged in the field of Cloud computing, namely Fog computing. This paradigm has proven to be highly useful in a wide range of domains where both delay and cost were important metrics. Notably, the Internet of Things (IoT) strongly benefits from this, as small devices can gain access to strong computation power quickly and at a low cost. To achieve this, task offloading is used to decide which task should be executed on which node. The development of an efficient algorithm to address this problem could significantly enhance the sustainability of systems in various industrial, agricultural, autonomous vehicle, and other domains. This paper proposes a new variant of the Niche Pareto Genetic Algorithm (NPGA) called Local search Drafting-NPGA (LD-NPGA) to optimize resource allocation in a Cloud/Fog environment, with the objective of minimizing makespan and cost simultaneously. It generates Pareto solutions allowing the user to make choices closer to its intentions. Thus, it addresses various shortcomings identified in the state of the art, including scalability and aggregation formula. A drafting step is implemented to maintain diversity in the population of solutions, resulting in a more varied Pareto set than basic NPGA. LD-NPGA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art metaheuristics in makespan and cost by 15%. Finally, the scalability of our approach and the variety of solutions generated are confirmed in the different experiments.\n\n- ### [Investigation on the effect of coupling factors on combustion performance of a hydrogen fueled two-strut scramjet combustor](/science/article/pii/S0360319924029094)\n\n\n\n2024, International Journal of Hydrogen Energy\n\n\n\nShow abstract\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis study focuses on numerically exploring the effect of coupling factors on enhanced combustion performance in a two-strut scramjet combustor. The impact of five geometric variables, namely _d_ (the vertical distance between the two struts), _ur_( _lr_) (the radius of the upper(lower) strut\u2019 tip), and _ul_( _ll_) (the length of the upper(lower) strut), is investigated through univariate analysis. While increasing _ur_ and _lr_ intensifies shocks at the cost of great total pressure loss, decreasing _ul_( _ll_) strengthens the upper(lower)flame but compresses the other. Besides, changing _d_ influences the interaction of shocks and shear layers. To investigate the coupling effect of these variables, the combustion efficiency of the two-strut combustor is optimized through the SEGA algorithm based on a Kriging model built by small sampling points in 5D design space, which increases combustion efficiency by 14% and thrust by 27%. The optimum design features small _ur_ and zero _lr_, larger _d_ and _ll_ and smaller _ul_. Further analysis performed on it revealed that the mechanism for enhancing combustion performance involves coupling the five geometry variables to assist combustion of the fuel closer to the upper expanding wall via stronger shock waves. Simultaneously, it weakens the shocks induced by the other strut to balance the total pressure loss.\n\n- ### [Energy/freshwater sustainability in urban areas through a novel solar-driven system with H2 production/liquefaction: Techno-economic evaluation and multi-objective optimization](/science/article/pii/S0957582024005639)\n\n\n\n2024, Process Safety and Environmental Protection\n\n\n\nShow abstract\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe application of solar-based power plants systems in cities offers various advantages. These include reducing reliance on fossil fuels, declining carbon emissions, and supporting efforts to address climate change. Additionally, solar energy enhances energy resilience, promotes economic growth, and generates employment opportunities through investments in solar infrastructure. The primary goal of the current investigation is to meet the daily energy requirements of environmentally friendly urban areas. The setup includes the utilization of various processes such as LNG regasification, parabolic trough solar collectors, dual-loop power cycles, reverse osmosis, and a unit for liquefaction and hydrogen production. The analysis shows that the evaluated plant generates a net output electricity of 1994\u202fkW and has a levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) of 5.1 Cent/kWh. Furthermore, the system effectively caters to the water demand of 32.21\u202fkg/s and cooling requirement of 392\u202fkW for residential purposes. In addition, it exhibits the capability to generate hydrogen at a rate of 9.49\u202fkg/h, which is subsequently stored in a liquid state. The study findings indicate that adjusting the pressure of the compressor has a substantial influence on liquefaction work. Initially, the work increases with increasing pressure, reaches a peak, and subsequently declines. It is crucial to maintain the recommended pressure level of approximately 5\u202fMPa for optimal performance. This pressure level leads to an efficiency of 17.01% and a coefficient of performance (COP) of 0.16. According to the multi-objective optimization, the optimized system demonstrates a shorter payback period of 3.38 years compared to the baseline system's 4.03 years, despite having higher initial costs. Over a 20-year lifespan, the optimized system is more profitable, surpassing the baseline system by approximately $2.4 million.\n\n- ### [Football team training algorithm: A novel sport-inspired meta-heuristic optimization algorithm for global optimization](/science/article/pii/S095741742303590X)\n\n\n\n2024, Expert Systems with Applications\n\n\n\nShow abstract\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA more efficient optimization algorithm has always been the pursuit of researchers, but the performance of the current optimization algorithm in some complex test functions is not always satisfactory. In order to solve this problem, a new _meta_-heuristic optimization algorithm\u2014Football Team Training Algorithm ( **_FTTA_**) is proposed according to the training method of the football team, which simulates the three stages of the training session: Collective Training, Group Training and Individual Extra Training. By the test on two groups of test functions, CEC2005 and CEC2020, the proposed optimization algorithm ( **_FTTA_**) achieves the best results, which far exceeds the traditional Grey Wolf Optimization ( **_GWO_**), Whale Optimization Algorithm ( **_WOA_**) algorithms and so on. In the engineering application, a new hybrid wind speed prediction system is proposed based on **_FTTA_**. The **_FTTA_** is used to optimize variational mode decomposition ( **_VMD_**) to improve the effect of data denoising. At the same time, based on unconstrained weighting algorithm, **_FTTA_** and combination prediction model build a new hybrid prediction strategy. Through the experiments on four groups of wind speed data in **_Dalian_**, the accuracy, stability, advancement, and CPU running speed of the system are verified. It is obvious that the practical application ability of the system is much better than previous methods, which can effectively improve the utilization efficiency of renewable energy.\n\n- ### [Tendon layout optimization in statically indeterminate structures using neural networks and genetic algorithm](/science/article/pii/S014102962400275X)\n\n\n\n2024, Engineering Structures\n\n\n\nShow abstract\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrestressing is a viable and effective technique used in concrete structures that allows the improvement of their performance. Its efficiency depends on the layout of the tendons, understood as the number of strands, their profile, curvature, and eccentricities. Layout design is a laborious and usually iterative trial-and-error process that aims to ensure that stress limits are not exceeded while, on the other hand, to minimize the total weight of prestressing steel. To automate the process, this research presents a novel genetic algorithm and a machine learning-based approach with a parametrically defined geometry of a tendon consisting of straight lines and circular arcs. The paper describes assumptions, implementation, and validation of the methods using a two-span two-girder bridge structure as an example. The genetic algorithm was incorporated to minimize the total weight of prestressing steel and ensure a correct design with no limit state exceedances. Since prestress evaluation in statically indeterminate structures requires repetitive and time-consuming numerical simulations, usually finite element analysis (FEA), a neural network was used to predict numerical output based on the layout parameters. The introduction of the neural network significantly reduced the total computation time. The results show the usability of the proposed approach in further studies and in engineering practice.\n\n\n[View all citing articles on Scopus](http://www.scopus.com/scopus/inward/citedby.url?partnerID=10&rel=3.0.0&eid=2-s2.0-84908460071&md5=9e462ab82e619a94163a99f7b3e00de)\n\n![](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S1568494614003901-fx2.jpg)\n\n**Hari Mohan Pandey** obtained M.Tech degree in Computer Engineering from Mukesh Patel School of Technology Management & Engineering.

Time series analysis is the\n\nprocess of using statistical techniques to model and explain a time-\n\ndependent series of data points. Time series forecasting is the\n\nprocess of using a model to generate predictions (forecasts) for\n\nfuture events based on known past events. Time series data has a\n\nnatural temporal ordering - this differs from typical data mining/\n\nmachine learning applications where each data point is an inde-\n\npendent example of the concept to be learned, and the ordering of\n\ndata points within a data set does not matter. Time series predic-\n\ntion proposes algorithms for which past data (mainly finite observa-\n\ntion sequences of data points related to uniform time interval) are\n\nused to generate models to forecast future data points of the series\n\n\\[1-3,11,12\\].\n\nThere are only two broad types of forecasting techniques-\n\nQualitative methods and Quantitative methods. Qualitativefore-\n\ncasting techniques are often subjective in nature and require judg-\n\nment on the part of experts. Quantitative forecasting techniques\n\nmake formal use of historical data and a forecasting model.\n\nIn this analysis, four models namely Multiple Linear Regression in\n\nExcel, Multiple Linear Regression of Dedicated Time Series Analy-\n\nsis in Weka, Vector Autoregressive Model in R and Neural Network\n\nModel using NeuralWorks Predict is analyzed.\n\nMultiple Linear Regression in Excel\n\nRegression models make use of relationships between the variable\n\nof interest and one or more related predictor variables. Sometimes\n\nregression models are called causal forecasting models, because\n\nthe predictor variables are assumed to describe the forces that\n\ncause or drive the observed values of the variable of interest.\n\nRegression analysis is a statistical technique for modeling and\n\ninvestigating the relationships between an outcome or response\n\nvariable and one or more predictor or regressor variables. The end\n\nresult of a regressionanalysis study is often to generate a model\n\nthat can be used to forecast or predict future values of the re-\n\nsponse variable given specified values of the predictor variables.\n\nThe Multiple Linear Regression Modelis\n\n(1)\n\nThe parameters \u03b20,\u03b21 \u2026\u03b22 in this model are often called partial\n\nregression coefficients because they convey information about the\n\neffect on y of the predictor that they multiply given that all of the\n\nother predictors in the model do not change. The regression mod-\n\nels in \\[Eq-1\\] is linearregression models because they are linear in\n\nthe unknown parameters (the\u03b2's), and not because they neces-\n\nsarily describe linear relationships between the response and the\n\nregressors.\n\nMultiple Linear Regression of Dedicated Time Series Analysis\n\nin Weka\n\nWEKA, formally called Waikato Environment for Knowledge Learn-\n\ning, is a computer program that was developed at the University of\n\nWaikato in New Zealand for the purpose of identifying information\n\nfrom raw data gathered from agricultural domains. WEKA supports\n\nmany different standard data mining tasks such as data prepro-\n\ncessing, classification, clustering, regression, visualizationand\n\nfeature selection. Weka (>= 3.7.3) now has a dedicated time series\n\nanalysis environment that allows forecasting models to be devel-\n\noped, evaluated and visualized. This environment takes the form of\n\na plugin tab in Weka's graphical \"Explorer\" user interface and can\n\nbe installed via the packagemanager. Weka's time series frame-\n\nwork takes a machine learning/data miningapproach to modeling\n\ntime series by transforming the data into a form that standard prop-\n\nositional learning algorithms can process. It does this by removing\n\nthe temporal ordering of individual input examples by encoding the\n\ntime dependency via additional input fields. These fields are some-\n\ntimes referred to as \"lagged\" variables. Various other fields are also\n\ncomputed automatically to allow the algorithms to model trends\n\nand seasonality. After the data has been transformed, any of We-\n\nka's regression algorithms can be applied to learn a model. An\n\nobvious choice is to apply multiple linear regression, but any meth-\n\nod capable of predicting a continuous target can be applied - in-\n\ncluding powerful non-linear methods such as support vector ma-\n\nchines for regression and model trees.

A VAR consists of a set\n\nof K endogenous variables yt= (y1t, ykt,\u2026.. yKt) for k = 1,.... K. The\n\nVAR (p)-process is then defined as:\n\n(2)\n\nwith Aiare (K \u00d7 K) coefficient matrices for i = 1,..., p and ut is a K-\n\ndimensional white noise process with time invariant positive definite\n\ncovariance matrix E (utut\u2018) = \u2211u. \\[Eq-2\\] is sometimes written in the\n\nform of a lag polynomial\n\n(3)\n\nwhere the matrix C is the coefficient matrix of potentially determin-\n\nistic regressors with dimension (K \u00d7M), and Dt is an (M \u00d71) column\n\nvector holding the appropriate deterministic regressors, such as a\n\nconstant, trend, and dummy and/or seasonal dummy variables\n\nOne important characteristic of a VAR (p)-process is its stability.\n\nThe stability of an empirical VAR(p)-process can be analyzed by\n\nconsidering the companion form and calculating the eigenvalues of\n\nthe coefficient matrix. If the moduli of the eigenvalues of A are less\n\nthan one, then the VAR (p)-process is stable.\n\nThe information criteria are implemented in the functions VAR ()\n\nand VARselect () contained in the package vars. In the former\n\nfunction, an appropriate VAR (p)-model will be estimated by provid-\n\ning the maximal lag number, lag.max, and the desired criterion.\n\nThe calculations are based upon the same sample size. That is,\n\nlag.max values are used as starting values for each of the estimat-\n\ned models. Theresult of the function VARselect () is a list object\n\nwith elements selection and criteria. The element selection is a\n\nvector of optimal lag length according to the above-mentioned in-\n\nformation criteria. The element criteria is a matrix containing the\n\nparticular values for each of these criteria up to the maximal lag\n\norder chosen.\n\nNeural Network Model using NeuralWorks Predict\n\nArtificial neural networks were inspired in large part by research\n\ninto the function of neurons in the human brain. Artificial neural\n\nnetworks process information in a way that resembles the way the\n\nbrain works. Like the brain, neural networks \u201clearn\u201d from experi-\n\nence during a process called training.\n\nWe can use neural networks when unknown relationships exist in\n\nhistorical data. A historical dataset consists of recorded input val-\n\nues and their corresponding output values. Neural networks can\n\ndetect patterns in data, generalize about relationships in data, and\n\ngenerate an output value when given a new set of input values\n\nfrom the problem domain. Analysts who lack extensive domain\n\nknowledge can use neural networks to solve problemsthat prove\n\ntoo complex for more conventional analytical techniques.\n\nHow a Neural Network Learns\n\nThe human brain is a very complex system of interconnected neu-\n\nrons. Similarly, a neural network is an interconnected system of\n\nartificial \u201cneurons.\u201d In neural network terminology, neurons are\n\ncalled Processing Elementsor nodes. Like a neuron in thebrain,\n\neach Processing Element (PE) can accept input data, process the\n\ndata, and pass it to the next PE. A PE processes data using one of\n\nseveral types of mathematical functions. In effect an entire neural\n\nnetwork represents a composite of the functions represented by all\n\nPEs.\n\nThe key to building a robust neural network is to collect many ex-\n\namples (or records) of input values and corresponding output val-\n\nues over time. The neural network uses this historical data to deter-\n\nmine (learn) a mathematical relationship between the input data\n\nand the output data.\n\nNetwork Architecture\n\nIn a neural network, PEs canbe interconnected in various ways.\n\nTypically, PEs are structured into layers and the output values of\n\nPEs in one layer serve as inputvalues forPEs in the next layer.\n\nEach connection has a weightassociated with it. In most cases, a\n\nProcessing Element calculates a weighted sum of incoming values\n\n(the sum the outputs of the PEs connected from the next lower\n\nlevel multiplied by their connection weights). This sum is called the\n\nactivation value. The activation value is then passed to the PE\u2019s\n\nnon-linear transfer functionto produce an output for that PE. This\n\ncombination of PEs, connections, weights, and transfer functions\n\nform the network architecture. This architecture then represents a\n\ncomplex mathematical formula that has been derived from histori-\n\ncal data.\n\nTraining a Neural Network\n\nNeural networks learn from \u201cexperience\u201d (exposure to information).\n\nFrom repeated exposure to historical data, a neural network learns\n\nto strengthen connection weights from PEs that have a greater\n\ntendency to accurately predict the desired output. The strength of\n\neach connection (the magnitude of the connection weight) increas-\n\nes or decreases based on its influence in producing the output\n\nassociated with each input data record in the historical dataset.\n\nConnection weights are adjusted during training.\n\nTrainingis the process of repeatedly (iteratively) exposing a neural\n\nnetwork to examples of historical data. Each example contains\n\ninput variables, and the associated desired output. The desired\n\noutput is the value that the neural network should predict, given the\n\nassociated input values in the historical data. In neural network\n\nterminology, the desired output is called the target value. During\n\ntraining, network weights are adjusted according to a learning rule-\n\nan algorithm that specifies how the error between predicted outputs\n\nand target valuesshould be used to modify network weights. Be-\n\nfore training begins, a simple network with the necessary number\n\nof input and output PEs is created. All connection weights are ini-\n\ntialized to small random values. Data examples from the training\n\nsetare passed to the network and the network produces an output\n\nvalue. This value is compared to the target value. The weights are\n\nadjusted in order to decrease the error between the network output\n\nand the target value. In addition, more processing elements are\n\nadded to the network if doing so helps decrease the error of the\n\nnetwork. Training continues until the neural network produces out-\n\nput values that match the target values within a specified accuracy\n\nlevel, or until some other stopping criterion is satisfied.\n\nTesting and Validating a Neural Network\n\nJust as you might test a person\u2019s skill in a controlled environment,\n\nyou testa neural network using historical data it has not seen.

This means that the network might closely predict the\n\ntarget values onthe training data but produce inferior results for\n\nnew data. Training for too long (too many passes through the train-\n\ning set) can cause the function to become very complex in order to\n\nproduce the target values at the expense of generalizingwell on\n\nunseen data. However, if a network is not trained long enough, it\n\ndoesn\u2019t fully learn trends and relationships in the data.\n\nOne way of knowing when to stop training is to automaticallyand\n\nperiodically test the performance on a test setduring training.\n\nWhen the performance starts to degrade on the test set, it's time to\n\nstop training-theneural network has started to learnrelationships\n\nwhich are specific to only the training set! At the end oftraining, the\n\nneural network can be further tested on an additional independent\n\ntest set referred to as avalidation set.\n\nUsing a Neural Network\n\nAfter the neural network has been trained, it can be used to make\n\npredictions given input data for which the desired output value is\n\nunknown.\n\nNeuralWorks Predict\n\nNeuralWorks Predictis a complete application development envi-\n\nronment for creating and deploying real-time applications for fore-\n\ncasting, modeling, classification and clustering or grouping.

Monthly data is collected for the last 10 years from\n\n2000 to 2010, forpredicting exchange rates of 2011\\. Theoriginal\n\nrate of 2011 is available and then compared with the predicted\n\nvalues for calculating the accuracy of the models. The multiple\n\nvariables used on which exchange rate depends are CPI, Trade\n\nBalance (in million US dollars), GDP, Unemployment and Monetary\n\nBase (in billion dollars). The data for all the variables is collected\n\nfrom various financial sites like tradingeconomics, ycharts, cen-\n\nsus.gov etc. The explanation of the variables is:\n\n\uf0b7 CPI: Consumer Price Index (CPI) data measures inflation in an\n\neconomy. When inflation gets too high in a country, the Central\n\nbank may increase interest rates in order to ensure price stabil-\n\nity. This may cause the currency to rise in value as the addi-\n\ntional interest received makes the currency more desirable.\n\n\uf0b7 Trade Balance: A country's balance of trade is the total value\n\nof its exports, minus the total value of its imports. If this number\n\nis positive, the country is said tohave a favorable balance of\n\ntrade. If the difference is negative, the country has a trade gap,\n\nor trade deficit.\n\n\uf0b7 GDP: Gross Domestic Product is a measure of the overall eco-\n\nnomic output within a country\u2019s borders overa particular time,\n\ntypically a year. GDP is calculated by adding together the total\n\nvalue of annual output of all that country\u2019s goods and services.\n\nGDP can also be measured by income by considering the fac-\n\ntors producing the output-the capital and labor-or by expendi-\n\nture by government, individuals, and business on that output\n\n\uf0b7 Unemployment: Employment levels have an immediate im-\n\npact on economic growth. An increase in unemployment sig-\n\nnals a slowdown in the economy and possible devaluation of a\n\ncountry's currency because of declining confidence and lower\n\ndemand.\n\n\uf0b7 Monetary Base: In economics, the monetary base (also base\n\nmoney, money base, high-powered money, reserve money, or,\n\nin the UK, narrow money) is a term relating to (but not being\n\nequivalent to) the money supply (or money stock), the amount\n\nof money in the economy. The monetary base is highly liquid\n\nmoney that consists of coins, paper money (both as bank vault\n\ncash and as currency circulating in the public), and commercial\n\nbanks' reserves with the central bank.\n\nSteps and Results of Time Series Data\n\nThe steps of the models and the corresponding results obtainedby\n\nusing the four models are:\n\nMultiple Linear Regression in Excel\n\n\uf0b7 Steps for performing this Model are:\n\n\uf0b7 Load the data in excel file.\n\n\uf0b7 Generate the regression equation by applying the Multiple Lin-\n\near Regression.\n\n\uf0b7 Forecast the data for the specified year.\n\n\uf0b7 Compare the forecasted value with the actual value.\n\nAdvances in Information Mining\n\nISSN: 0975-3265 & E-ISSN: 0975-9093, Volume 4, Issue 1, 2012\n\nPerformance Comparison of Time Series Data Using Predictive Data Mining Techniques\n\nBioinfo Publications 61\n\n\uf0b7 Compute ME, MAE, MSE, RMSE, MPE and MAPE.\n\n\\[Fig-2\\] represents graph showing comparison between actual ex-\n\nchange rate of 2011 (shown by blue line) and predicted exchange\n\nrate of 2011 (shown by red line) using Multiple Linear Regression\n\nin Excel.

It does this by taking the log of each\n\ntarget before creating lagged variables and building the model.\n\nThis can be useful if the variance (how much the data jumps\n\naround) increases or decreases over the course of time.

Select checkboxes of required metrics.\n\n\uf0b7 Select the Output panel, it provides options that control what\n\ntextual and graphical output are produced by the system.

One can subtract the forecast value from the observed\n\nvalue of the data at that time point and obtain a measure of error.\n\nTo evaluate the amount of this forecast error, the researcher may\n\nemploy the mean error or the mean absolute error. Let A tis the\n\nactual data and Ft represents the forecast and n denotes the num-\n\nber of forecasts made. Then the mean error (ME) is merely the\n\naverage error.\n\nThe mean absolute error (MAE) or mean absolute deviation (MAD)\n\nis calculated by taking the absolute value of the difference between\n\nthe estimated forecast and the actual valueat the same time so\n\nthat the negative values do not cancel the positive values. The\n\naverage of these absolute values is taken to obtain the mean abso-\n\nlute error.\n\nThe mean squared error (MSE) measure the variability in forecast\n\nerrors. Obviously, the variability in forecast errors must be small.\n\nME, MAE and MSE are all scale dependent measures of forecast\n\naccuracy, that is, their values are expressed in terms of the original\n\nunits of measurement.\n\nThe root mean square error (RMSE) measures the average magni-\n\ntude of the error. In it, the difference between forecast and corre-\n\nsponding observed values are each squared and then averaged\n\nover the sample. Finally, the square root of the average is taken.\n\nSince the errors are squared before they are averaged, the RMSE\n\ngives a relatively high weight to large errors. This means the RMSE\n\nis most useful when large errors are particularly undesirable.\n\nThe percentage error (MPE) is the proportion of error at a particular\n\npoint of time in the series. The average percentage error in the\n\nentire series is a general measure of fit useful in comparing the fits\n\nof different models. This measure adds up all of the percentage\n\nerrors at each time point anddivides them by the number of time\n\npoints.\n\nBecause the positive and negative errors may tend to cancel them-\n\nselves, MPE statistic is often replaced by the mean absolute per-\n\ncentage error (MAPE).\n\nMAPE is the more objective statistic indicator because the measure\n\nis in relative percentage and will not be affected by the unit of the\n\nforecasting series. The closer MAPE approaches zero, the better\n\nthe forecasting results\n\nThe prediction errors are calculated using all mentioned perfor-\n\nmance measures i.e. ME, MAE, MSE, RMSE, MPE and MAPE for\n\nall the four models namely Multiple Linear Regression in Excel,\n\nMultiple Linear Regression of Dedicated Time Series Analysis in\n\nWeka, Vector Autoregressive Model in R and Neural Network Mod-\n\nel using NeuralWorks Predict and shown in \\[Table-7\\].\n\nTable 7- Performance of all Models are compared through ME,\n\nMAE, MSE, RMSE, MPE and MAPE\n\nWhich Performance Measure Is Best?\n\nFollowing observations are made from the performance measures:\n\n\uf0b7 It is usually best to report the root mean squared error (RMSE)\n\nrather than mean squared error (MSE), because the RMSE is\n\nmeasured in the same units as the data, rather than in squared\n\nunits, and is representative of the size of a \"typical\" error.\n\n\uf0b7 The mean absolute error (MAE) is also measured in the same\n\nunits as the original data, and is usually similar in magnitude to,\n\nbut slightly smaller than, the root mean squared error. The\n\nmathematically challenged usually find this an easier statistic to\n\nunderstand than the RMSE.\n\n\uf0b7 The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) is also often use-\n\nful for purposes of reporting, because it is expressed in generic\n\npercentage terms which will make some kind of sense even to\n\nsomeone who has no idea what constitutes a \"big\" error in\n\nterms of dollars spent or widgets sold. The MAPE can only be\n\ncomputed with respect to data that are guaranteed to be strictly\n\npositive.\n\n\uf0b7 The mean error (ME) and mean percentage error (MPE) that\n\nare reported in some statistical procedures are signed\n\nmeasures of error which indicate whether the forecasts are\n\nbiased--i.e., whether they tend to be disproportionately positive\n\nor negative. Bias is normally considered a bad thing, but it is\n\nnot the bottom line. Bias is one component of the mean\n\nsquared error--in fact mean squared error equals thevariance\n\nof the errors plus the square of the mean error. That is: MSE =\n\nVAR (E) + (ME) ^ 2.\n\n\uf0b7 The root mean squared error is more sensitive than other\n\nmeasures to the occasionallarge error: the squaring process\n\ngives disproportionate weight to very large errors. If an occa-\n\nsional large error is not a problem in decision situation, then the\n\nMAE or MAPE may be a more relevant criterion. In many cases\n\nthese statistics will vary in unison--the model that is best on\n\none of them will also be better on the others--but this may not\n\nbe the case when the error distribution has \"outliers.\"\n\n\uf0b7 If one model's RMSE is 30% lower than another's, that is prob-\n\nably very significant. If it is 10% lower, that is probably some-\n\nwhat significant. If it is only 2% better, that is probably not sig-\n\nnificant. These distinctions are especially important when we\n\nare trading off model complexity against the error measures: it\n\nis probably not worth adding another independent variable to a\n\nregression model to decrease the RMSE by only a few more\n\npercent.\n\n\uf0b7 The confidence intervals for one-step-ahead forecasts are\n\nbased almost entirely on RMSE, the confidence intervals for\n\nthe longer-horizon forecasts than can be produced by time-\n\nseries models depend heavily on the underlying modelingas-\n\nsumptions, particularly assumptions about the variability of the\n\ntrend.

The rate at which the confidence intervals\n\nwiden is not a reliable guide to model quality: what is important\n\nis the model should be making thecorrect assumptions about\n\nhow uncertain the future is. It is very important that the model\n\nshould pass the various residual diagnostic tests and \"eyeball\"\n\ntests in order for the confidence intervals for longer-horizon\n\nforecasts to be taken seriously.\n\nSo the observation states that mostly the performance of compared\n\nmodels depends on RMSE, but sometimes MAE or MAPE. Also, If\n\ntwo models are generally similar in terms of their error statistics\n\nand other diagnostics, you should prefer the one that is simpler\n\nand/or easier to understand. The simpler model is likely to be clos-\n\ner to the truth, and it will usually be more easily accepted by others.\n\nForecasts from the four models are compared together with the\n\nactual usage. It is observed that forecasts from the Dedicated Time\n\nSeries Model using Weka are closer to the actual demands than\n\nthe forecasts from other three models.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn nowadays technology, financial institutions are able to produce\n\nhuge datasets that build a foundation for approaching these enor-\n\nmously complex and dynamic problems with data mining tools.\n\nWith vast data and literature in this field the potential significant\n\nbenefits of solving these problems motivated extensive research\n\nfor years. The mostly used data mining application applied to the\n\nfield of finance is the modeling (predicting or forecasting) of finan-\n\ncial data. Almost every statistical and mathematical computational\n\nmethod has been explored and used for financial modeling.\n\nIn this paper, four models namely Multiple Linear Regression in\n\nExcel, Multiple Linear Regression of Dedicated Time Series Analy-\n\nsis in Weka, Vector Autoregressive Model in R and Neural Network\n\nModel using NeuralWorks Predict are analyzed using real time\n\nseries data. The daily exchanges of currency between the U.S. and\n\nother nations have a major effect on international trade. There are\n\nmany advantages and disadvantages associated with strong and\n\nweak U.S dollars. This study will be helpful to learners and experts\n\nalike as they choose the best approach to solving basic data-\n\nmining problems. This will help in reducing the lead time for getting\n\nthe best prediction possible.\n\nThe models have shown favorable forecasting accuracy with Linear\n\nRegression of Dedicated Time Series Analysis in Weka outper-\n\nforming the other three models.\n\nReferences\n\n\\[1\\] Hagan M.T. and Behr S.M.

This study aims to characterize the temporal usage of an RNS, Columbia University Scientific Profiles (CUSP), and to inform the designs of general RNSs. We installed a free usage logging service, Google Analytics, on CUSP and applied time series analysis to compare the usage patterns of the two modes of CUSP: restricted (authenticated) and open access. More users searched by person names than by topics, although the latter enables in-depth vertical search of co-author or co-investigator networks for grants or publications.

No Power is Costlier than No Power. So electricity becomes the indispensable one to us. And in the smart grid environment, the electricity consumers will act in response to electricity demand. But the construction of large generating plants like Thermal, Nuclear, Atomic and Wind Power Station and Plants takes many years. The Government is determining the demand of electricity well in advance. So, demand is to be forecasted for smooth running of all works in society. This paper presents a state-of-the-art survey of Tamil Nadu Electricity Board Dataset structure and Electricity Load Demand of Madurai Metro, Madurai EDC, Theni, Dindugal, Ramnad and Sivagangai Circles of Madurai Region in Tamil Nadu Electricity Board (TNEB) are forecasted by Gaussian Process and WEKA Data Mining Tool using real time data.\n\n[View](publication/271468735_Knowledging_on_Tamil_Nadu_electricity_board_TNEB_and_electricity_load_demand_forecasting_by_Gaussian_processes_using_real_time_data)\n\nShow abstract\n\n[Unsupervised learning algorithm for time series using bivariate AR(1) model](publication/259519056_Unsupervised_learning_algorithm_for_time_series_using_bivariate_AR1_model)\n\nArticle\n\n- Jun 2014\n- EXPERT SYST APPL\n\n- [![Vedavathi Katneni](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAADUlEQVR42mN89OjNfwAJDwOxHEacwgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)Vedavathi Katneni](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Vedavathi-Katneni)\n- [![K.

Clustering and classification of time series has the potential to analyze large volumes of data. Most of the traditional time series clustering and classification algorithms deal only with univariate time series data. In this paper, we develop an unsupervised learning algorithm for bivariate time series. The initial clusters are found using K-means algorithm and the model parameters are estimated using the EM algorithm. The learning algorithm is developed by utilizing component maximum likelihood and Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC). The performance of the developed algorithm is evaluated using real time data collected from a pollution centre. A comparative study of the proposed algorithm is made with the existing data mining algorithm that uses univariate autoregressive process of order 1 (AR(1)) model. It is observed that the proposed algorithm out performs the existing algorithms.\n\n[View](publication/259519056_Unsupervised_learning_algorithm_for_time_series_using_bivariate_AR1_model)\n\nShow abstract\n\n[Input selection and optimisation for monthly rainfall forecasting in Queensland, Australia, using artificial neural networks](publication/259511313_Input_selection_and_optimisation_for_monthly_rainfall_forecasting_in_Queensland_Australia_using_artificial_neural_networks)\n\nArticle\n\n- Mar 2014\n- ATMOS RES\n\n- [![John Abbot](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAADUlEQVR42mN89OjNfwAJDwOxHEacwgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)John Abbot](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/John-Abbot-3)\n- [![Jennifer Marohasy](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAADUlEQVR42mN89OjNfwAJDwOxHEacwgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)Jennifer Marohasy](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jennifer-Marohasy-2)\n\n[View](publication/259511313_Input_selection_and_optimisation_for_monthly_rainfall_forecasting_in_Queensland_Australia_using_artificial_neural_networks)\n\n[Time Series Analysis and Its Applications With R Examples](publication/265365840_Time_Series_Analysis_and_Its_Applications_With_R_Examples)\n\nBook\n\nFull-text available\n\n- Jan 2011\n\n- [Robert H.

Inspired by data mining, the new method employs time-delayed embedding and identifies temporal patterns in the resulting phase spaces. An optimization method is applied to search the phase spaces for optimal heterogeneous temporal pattern clusters that reveal hidden temporal patterns, which are characteristic and predictive of time series events. The fundamental concepts and framework of the method are explained in detail. The method is then applied to the characterization and prediction, with a high degree of accuracy, of the release of metal droplets from a welder. The results of the method are compared to those from a Time Delay Neural Network and the C4.5 decision tree algorithm.\n\n[View](publication/3297128_A_new_temporal_pattern_identification_method_for_characterization_and_prediction_of_complex_time_series_events)\n\nShow abstract\n\n[Time Series: Theory and Methods](publication/263047680_Time_Series_Theory_and_Methods)\n\nBook\n\n- Jan 1986\n\n- [![Peter J.

Cell phones which were primarily developed to make phone calls, have now turned out to be a necessity and are just not limited to calling. They have taken over many gadgets which are useful in day to day lives. Every day people encounter a significant number of better and improved features being embedded into them. Today they are available in all shape and sizes and within every budget, this is primarily due to two reasons, the first being an exponential growth in the number of users and the other being the persistent entry of new manufacturers in the market. This puts users into dilemma to select an idle smartphone for them because manufactures are offering smartphones at cut throat prices with a wide range of features, so in this paper the aim is to utilize the MCDM (multi criteria decision making approach) approach by employing the technique of EDAS (Evaluation Based on Distance from Average Solution) to evaluate the previously selected smartphones available in Indian market under a particular budget to choose the most appropriate phone for the users.\n\n- Previousarticle in issue\n- Nextarticle in issue\n\n## Keywords\n\nattributes\n\nalternatives\n\ncriteria\n\nEvaluation based on Distance from Average Solution\n\nMulti criteria decision making\n\nSmartphone\n\nRecommended articles\n\n\u00a9 2018 The Author(s).

It critiques existing methods that primarily focus on subjective assessments and proposes a novel metric that combines both subjective and objective evaluations using Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) and the entropy method. The authors argue that while subjective measures rely on user perceptions and inputs which can vary widely, objective parameters like response time and ease of navigation are critical and can be quantitatively assessed.\n\nThe usability evaluation considered criteria such as Ease of Navigation (EON), Ease of Use (EOU), Informativeness (INF), and Response Time (RT). The study involved a mixed-method approach where user feedback was collected through surveys alongside objective assessments of website performance. The integrated metric developed allows for a comprehensive usability score that reflects the quality and effectiveness of a website. The findings indicated a significant correlation between usability scores and user satisfaction, demonstrating the utility of the combined weighting approach.\n\nIn conclusion, this research lays the groundwork for more accurate usability assessments, advocating for a balanced approach that integrates both subjective perceptions and objective measures to enhance website usability for educational institutions.",

Usability is an\n\nimportant quality parameter which is matter of keen\n\ninterest for website designer and researcher. Like any\n\nsoftware, for website also, usability depends on the func-\n\ntionality and its impact on the user operating it. Many\n\nusability de\ufb01nitions are proposed in the literature as dif-\n\nferent authors have different opinion towards usability.\n\nAccording to Nielsen usability has multiple components.\n\nHe proposed \ufb01ve quality attributes of usability namely\n\nlearnability (\u2018\u2018system should be easy to learn\u2019\u2019), Ef\ufb01ciency\n\n(\u2018\u2018ef\ufb01cient to use\u2019\u2019), memorability (\u2018\u2018easy to remember\u2019\u2019),\n\nerrors (\u2018\u2018low error rate\u2019\u2019), satisfaction (\u2018\u2018pleasant to use\u2019\u2019)\n\n(Nielsen 1993). ISO 9241-11 has de\ufb01ned usability as \u2018\u2018the\n\nextent to which a product can be used by speci\ufb01ed users to\n\nachieve speci\ufb01ed goals with effectiveness, ef\ufb01ciency and\n\nsatisfaction in a speci\ufb01ed context of use\u2019\u2019 (Bevan 2001).\n\nAccording to ISO/IEC 9126 usability is a signi\ufb01cant con-\n\ntributor of design and evaluation of user interface and\n\nde\ufb01ned usability as \u2018\u2018Usability: a set of attributes that bear\n\non the effort needed for use, and on the individual\n\nassessment of such use, by a stated or implied set of users\u2019\u2019\n\n(Bevan 2001). Bevan incorporated ease of use in de\ufb01ning\n\nthe usability as \u2018\u2018the ease of use and acceptability of a\n\nsystem or product for a particular class of users carrying\n\nout speci\ufb01c tasks in a speci\ufb01c environment; where \u2018ease of\n\nuse\u2019 affects user performance and satisfaction, and \u2018ac-\n\nceptability\u2019 affects whether or not the product is used\u2019\u2019\n\n(Bevan et al. 1991). It can be quickly concluded that\n\nusability is not a single parameter, but it depends upon\n\nmany criteria\u2019s. These criteria\u2019s can broadly be classi\ufb01ed in\n\ntwo category \ufb01rstly those dependent on users needsand\n\npsychology considered as human-centric criteria and sec-\n\nondly those dependent on design and system features\n\nregarded as technical criteria\u2019s.\n\nThe human-centric criteria center around the satisfaction\n\nof user, i.e., the ease with which user can retrieve the\n\n&Renuka Nagpal\n\nrnagpal1@amity.edu\n\n1\n\nAmity School of Engineering and Technology, Amity\n\nUniversity Uttar Pradesh, Noida, India\n\n2\n\nGuru Jambeshwar University of Science and Technology,\n\nHisar, India\n\n123\n\nInt J Syst Assur Eng Manag\n\nDOI 10.1007/s13198-016-0462-y\n\nAuthor's personal copy\n\ndesired information. Each user has a different perspective\n\nand cognitive view for information. A speci\ufb01c information\n\nmay be presented on a website in a variety of ways. Each\n\nuser has a different expectation which may dependon their\n\nknowledge about personal domain need (i.e., the informa-\n\ntion they desire) and experience. The presence of complete,\n\naccurate, relevant and updated information will de\ufb01nitely\n\nimprove the informativeness of website. The quality of\n\ninformation present on the website can be evaluated in\n\nhuman perspective through questionnaire and feedback.\n\nAnother important factor that user want is an easyusageof\n\nthe website. Thus informativeness and ease of use are\n\nperspectives of the user and the combined value will re\ufb02ect\n\nthe user satisfaction, i.e., how easily user can retrieve the\n\ndesired information.\n\nThe second dimension of criteria centers around the\n\ntechnical features that will affect the performance of the\n\nwebsite. The design of the website, its structural com-\n\nplexity, and the navigational aids present on the website\n\nwill re\ufb02ect on ease of navigation, an important parameter\n\non which usability depends (Wang and Senecal 2007).\n\nAlso, Response Time (RT), which depends on the system\n\nspeci\ufb01cations like bandwidth, performance of client and\n\nserver systems etc. (Barber) affects inverselyto the\n\nusability of the website i.e., smaller the RT higher the\n\nusability.\n\nMeasuring usability of the website is a Multi Criteria\n\nDecision Making (MCDM) problem and in these cases, it is\n\nnecessary to design a set of index system for evaluating\n\neach criterion and determine the relative weight for each\n\ncriterion. There are various techniques which are purely\n\nsubjective in nature like Analytic Hierarchy Process\n\n(AHP), Fuzzy AHP, point estimation, judge matrix, etc.\n\nAlso in domains where we have mathematical models used\n\nmany objective techniques like Entropy, goal program-\n\nming, genetic algorithms, etc. (Hongjiu and Yanrong 2015)\n\nare used for selecting a correct option. Many methods have\n\nbeen discussed in literature for identifying the weights of\n\nMCDM problem. These methods focus subjective dimen-\n\nsion which includes user\u2019s perception and cognitive\n\napproach to view and understand website. These approa-\n\nches gather user input in various ways like questionnaire,\n\nfeedback, task completion, etc. to establish a relationship\n\nhow the user feels while using the site. As these approaches\n\nhave human dependency and individual have a different\n\nviewpoint and always inbuilt uncertainty in it, hence con-\n\nsidering crisp values in these cases is not justi\ufb01ed. Thus\n\nfuzzy approaches are widely adopted to measure the\n\nusability (Chang and Dillon 2006) and to ranking the\n\nwebsite. The expertise of Decision Makers (DM\u2019s) is\n\nconsidered as input to assign subjective importance of each\n\ncriterion. Uncertainty and biasness of DM\u2019s are few\n\ninherent weakness of subjective approach. To balance this\n\neffect an integrated approach combining objective and\n\nsubjective weight has been proposed for many MCDM\n\nproblem (Hongjiu and Yanrong 2015). Measuring these\n\nparameters will help each designer to increase overall\n\nusability. These functions are objective in nature and\n\nhence, suitable mathematical model or formula canbe used\n\nto evaluate the crisp value.\n\nIn this paper, objective and subjective approach are\n\nintegrated to propose new metric which incorporates both\n\nhuman input and design dimension. Thus, the proposed\n\nmetrics is more complete. The remaining paper is divided\n\ninto six section. The framework proposed to evaluate the\n\nusability is given in Sect. 2, In Sect. 3fuzzy concepts, an\n\nobjective and subjective method to determine weights\n\nusing entropy and FAHP methods respectively are dis-\n\ncussed. The combined weight assessment methodusing\n\nlinear combination approach is also described in this sec-\n\ntion. Section 4experiment conducted to measure each\n\nattribute namely Ease of Navigation (EON), Ease of Use\n\n(EOU), Informative (INF) and Response Time (RT) is\n\ngiven. Section 5computes the usability score by multi-\n\nplying the normalized value of each criterion with its\n\nrespective weights obtained in combined weighting vector.\n\nSection 6discusses the result and conclusion.\n\n2Framework for website usability\n\nMeasuring usability is Multi Criteria Decision Making\n\nproblem (MCDM). To design a metric of usability one\n\nshould identify the criteria contributing to the usability and\n\nthen measure the weights of these criteria re\ufb02ecting their\n\nrelative importance. Framework for evaluating the usability\n\nofthewebsiteisshowninFig. 1. Experiments are con-\n\nducted to measure each criterion. To bring each criterion\n\non the uniform scale, these criteria values are normalized.\n\nThe proposed usability of website ranges from 0 to 1 where\n\n1 re\ufb02ects 100% usability and 0% represents the site is not\n\nat all usable.\n\nFor determination of weights popularly there are two\n\napproaches namely subjective and objective method (Shi\n\net al. 2012). The Subjective method usually uses the\n\njudgments of the decision- makers (DM\u2019s) and in objective\n\nmethod, there is no input from the DM\u2019s, the weights for\n\nthe criteria are evaluated by using a mathematical model.\n\nFinally, the weights for the criteria are evaluated using an\n\nintegrated approach that combines both DM\u2019s preferences\n\n(subjective weighting method) and mathematical model\n\n(objective weighting methods). Shanon\u2019s entropy theory\n\n(Shannon 1948) is used to evaluate objective weights of the\n\ncriteria and Fuzzy AHP approach (Deng 1999) which\n\nre\ufb02ects the judgement of DM\u2019s is employed to assess the\n\nsubjective weights. The entropy method measures the\n\nInt J Syst Assur Eng Manag\n\n123\n\nAuthor's personal copy\n\nrelative contrast intensities of criteria while Fuzzy AHP\n\nuses the standard information as provided by experts. Each\n\ncriterion has its contributing weight for usability evalua-\n\ntion. The evaluated weights are rescaled to have the same\n\nrange, and combined weight assessment vector is evalu-\n\nated. Finally, usability score is estimated by multiplying\n\nthe normalized value of the criteria\u2019s with their respective\n\ncombined weights.\n\n3Research methodology\n\nThe mathematical concepts and models used in above\n\nframework are discussed in this section. It includes an\n\nintroduction to fuzzy set, their linguistic variables and its\n\nmembership is considered followed by a mathematical\n\nmodel for weight estimated method. Lastly Simple Addi-\n\ntive Weighting Method (SAW) is used to propose the\n\nusability metric of the website.\n\n3.1Fuzzy sets\n\nThe fuzzy set theory can productively express general\n\ninformation or individual perception using linguistic terms.\n\n3.2Linguistic variables\n\nAccording to Zadeh (1975) linguistic variables are vari-\n\nables whose values are represented in words orsentences in\n\na natural or arti\ufb01cial language. Linguistic variable are used\n\nin such situation that is complicated and hard to de\ufb01ne. The\n\ndomain of linguistic approach is speci\ufb01cally the intelligent\n\nsystems like arti\ufb01cial intelligence, pattern recognition,\n\ninformation retrieval and the related areas. As an example,\n\nheight can be given exact value; also, it can be represented\n\nas a linguistic variable if its values need to be compared\n\nusing fuzzy variables like short, very short, tall, etc. rather\n\nthan measuring exactly.\n\n3.3Triangular fuzzynumbers\n\nLinguistic variables simply approximate the individual\n\nperception of decision makers; the widely adopted Trian-\n\ngular Fuzzy Number (TFN) approach (Naghadehi et al.\n\n2009; Hsieh et al. 2004) is used to represent the uncertainty\n\nor vagueness of linguistic terms. A TFN can be de\ufb01ned by\n\na triplet low, medium, high (l,m,h) as given below using\n\nthe membership function:\n\nx\u00f0\u00de\u00bc\n\nx\ue003l\n\nm\ue003ll\ue004x\ue004m;\n\nm\ue003x\n\nh\ue003mm\ue004x\ue004h;\n\n0otherwise\n\n8\n\n>\n\n>\n\n>\n\n>\n\n<\n\n>\n\n>\n\n>\n\n>\n\n:\n\n9\n\n>\n\n>\n\n>\n\n>\n\n=\n\n>\n\n>\n\n>\n\n>\n\n;\n\nThe relationship between fuzzy number and corresponding\n\nlinguistic variable which identify the important weights for\n\neach criterion and membership function is given in Table1.\n\nVarious arithmetic operations that can be performed\n\nrelated to fuzzy numbers with triangular membership\n\nfunction are (Chen and Hwang 1992):\n\nIf A\u00bc\u00f0l1;m1;u1\u00deand B\u00bc\u00f0l2;m2;u2\u00deare two TFN\u2019s\n\nthen\n\nAddition: \u00f0A\u00feB\u00de\u00bc\u00f0l1\u00fel2;m1\u00fem2;u1\u00feu2\u00de\n\nMultiplication: \u00f0A\ue005B\u00de\u00bc\u00f0l1l2;m1m2;u1u2\u00de\n\nInverse: A\ue0031\u00bc\u00f01=u1;1=m1;1=l\u00de\n\n3.4Weighting method\n\nThis section discusses about subjective and objective\n\nweighting method and the linear combination approach\n\nbeing used to get combined weighting vector.\n\nSelecting the criteria for\n\nevaluating the usability\n\nEvaluation of weights for\n\nthe criteria\n\nApply Objective Method\n\nfor weight Calculation\n\nCombination Weighting Method\n\nApply Subjective method\n\nfor weight calculation\n\nDetermination of weights using\n\nCombination weighted method\n\nEvaluation of usability for\n\ndifferent alternatives\n\nEntropy FAHP\n\nEvaluation of criteria\n\nFig. 1Framework for websiteusability\n\nTable 1Linguistic variablefor importance weight of each criterion\n\n(Hsieh et al. 2004)\n\nFuzzy\n\nnumber\n\nLinguistic scalesMembership\n\nfunction\n\n1Equally important1, 1, 3\n\n3Weak important1, 3, 5\n\n5Essentially important3, 5, 7\n\n7Very strongly important5, 7, 9\n\n9Absolutely important7, 9, 9\n\nInt J Syst Assur Eng Manag\n\n123\n\nAuthor's personal copy\n\n3.4.1Objective method\n\nThe entropy method popularly used in thermodynamics as a\n\nmeasure of system disorder and was successfully introduced\n\nto information theory by Shannon (Shannon 1948). It is found\n\nto be very useful in multiattribute problems (Zhang and\n\nPolytechnic 2015; Liu and Cui 2008). The smaller the value of\n\ninformation entropy of the given parameter, the larger amount\n\nof contribution it will provide the comprehensive evaluation.\n\nThe entropy method maintains the balance among the chosen\n\ncriteria and determines the weight from the values collected.\n\nThe weight of the criteria is larger when the different objects\n\nunder consideration have a large difference between each\n\nother for those particular criteria reducing the entropy, and\n\nsmaller the difference smaller are the weights (Zou et al.\n\n2006). This method ignores the decision makers preference\n\nand is based onmathematical computation. The entropy\n\nweighting method consists of following steps.\n\nStep 1. Construct original data matrix using i alternatives\n\nand n criteria. The original data matrix can beformed as:\n\n\u00f01\u00de\n\nwhere, Ui(i =1 to m)\u2014the alternative website, Cj(j =1\n\nto n)\u2014evaluation criteria, xij (i =1, \u2026,m; j=1\u2026,n)\n\nrepresents the performance of alternative Uiunder alter-\n\nnative Cjrespectively.\n\nStep 2.

This\n\napproach is extended to FAHP (Buckley 1985) whichis\n\ncombined with fuzzy set theory to handle uncertainty\n\nproblems in decision making.

The\n\ncritical characteristics of the website on which its perfor-\n\nmance depend and the relative importance of these features\n\nvaries from organization to organization. The study of\n\nfeatures and their in\ufb02uence on the website plays an\n\nimportant role in framing the strategies for website design.\n\nThe website are classi\ufb01ed on different dimensions like\n\nfunctionality, complexity and others (Torrente et al. 2013).\n\nEach website have different criteria that in\ufb02uence the\n\nworking of website and needs to be evaluated for judging\n\noverall performance of the site.\n\nThe focus of this study is to evaluate usability ofweb-\n\nsites of academic institutes of higher education. Various\n\nresearchers have identi\ufb01ed large number of parameters that\n\naffect the usability of academic websites of higher educa-\n\ntion (Caglar and Mentes 2012; Islam and Tsuji 2011;\n\nBringula and Basa 2011; Hasan 2012). As discussed in\n\nintroduction these parameters can be broadly classi\ufb01ed into\n\ntwo categories namely user-centric and design oriented.\n\nAlso, in continuation of our previous work (Nagpal et al.\n\n2015b), based on literature survey, nine important criteria\n\nwere identi\ufb01ed. These criteria\u2019s were further \ufb01ltered based\n\non the feedback of the stakeholders (Nagpal et al. 2013)to\n\nfour critical criteria\u2019s that affects the usability of institute\n\nwebsites namely Ease of Navigation (EON), Ease of Use\n\n(EOU), Informative (INF) and Response Time (RT). These\n\ncriteria\u2019s together with combined assessment vector is used\n\nto evaluate the usability of the website. The EOU and INF\n\nare measured based on user inputs and is considered as\n\nsubjective criteria. A questionnaire having 20 questions of\n\nwhich 6 corresponds to EOU and 14 for measuring INF is\n\ndesigned. EON and RT are considered as objective criteria,\n\nand mathematical models are used for their evaluation as\n\nshown in Fig. 2. For datasample, feedback wastaken from\n\n100 undergraduate engineering student and 50 postgraduate\n\ntechnology students. They were given time to study the six\n\nwebsites in detail and answer the designed questionnaire.\n\nThe data was collected on Google docs. Illustration for\n\neach criterion is given as follows:\n\n4.1Ease of use (EOU)\n\nThe objective of the website is to facilitate the effective\n\ncompletion of the task associated with the website. There is\n\nno objective measure available to measure EOU. A prag-\n\nmatic approach is developed towards a website if theuser\n\ncan achieve its goal easily and quickly. A subjective\n\nmeasure is taken to measure EOU. Users are given set of\n\nquestionnaire to provide their feedback on \u20181\u20135\u2019 Likert\n\nscale. \u20185\u2019 Value on the scale is for strong agreementand \u20181\u2019\n\nwith sharp disagreement. The average is calculated for all\n\nratings provided by the user for each question. The overall\n\nscore for EOU for each website is obtained by averaging all\n\nthequestionnairesasgiveninTable 2. For e.g. Website\n\n(U1) is rated 3.425 which implies the EOU is68.5 %.\n\n4.2Informative (INF)\n\nLike EOU, there is no objective measure available to gauge\n\nthe informativeness of a website. A questionnaire has been\n\ndeveloped to evaluate the extent to which information\n\nprovided on the website is correct, accurate, complete and\n\nupdated. The students were asked to \ufb01nd speci\ufb01c infor-\n\nmation relating to details of the organization like hostel\n\nSubjective Criteria\n\nObjective Criteria\n\nEase of Use(EOU)\n\nInformative(INF)\n\nResponse\n\nTime(RT)\n\nEase of\n\nNavigation(EON)\n\nWebsite(U1)\n\nWebsite(U2)\n\nWebsite(U3)\n\nWebsite(U4)\n\nWebsite(U5)\n\nWebsite(U6)\n\nUsability of\n\nWebsite\n\nFig. 2Evaluation model\n\nInt J Syst Assur Eng Manag\n\n123\n\nAuthor's personal copy\n\nfacilities, on-campus services, placement details, etc. The\n\nquestionnaire includes 14 questions (\u2018\u2018Appendix\u2019\u2019) which\n\ncover the complete information what usually students like\n\nto see on the website. The degree to which they can fetch\n\nthe required information successfully is considered as an\n\nindicative of informativeness of the website Table 3.\n\n4.3Ease of navigation(EON)\n\nA website is the collection of information, and it should be\n\norganized in such a way that navigation becomes easy.\n\nNavigation depends upon on how information is organized\n\nand arranged in terms of design, layout, sequencing,\n\neffectiveness of hyperlinks, etc. To increase theEON, each\n\nwebsite provides certain navigational aids links like quick\n\nlinks, breadcrumb trail, internal search engine, etc. which\n\nhelps to overcome the navigational complexity especially\n\nin the case of big websites. \u2018\u2018How\u2019\u2019 easily one can navigate\n\nthrough entire site depend on two factors shown in Fig. 3.\n\nStructural Complexity and Navigational Aids. Power\n\nMapper Tool is used to construct the sitemap. Thelimita-\n\ntion of the tool is that it can draw the site map for maxi-\n\nmum 1000 pages.\n\nA tree structure is created using the sitemap. With the\n\nhelp of the tree structure the total no. of pages, no. of\n\noutlinks (pages linking to other pages), total number of\n\nlinks in the graph (\u2018e\u2019),total number of nodes (\u2018n\u2019) and total\n\ndead end nodes i.e. number of broken links (\u2018d\u2019) is eval-\n\nuated. Overall Website Structural Complexity (WSC) is\n\ncalculated by taking the average sum of WSC\n\n1\n\nand WSC\n\n2\n\ngiven in Fig. 3.\n\nEON is high if the structural complexity is less which\n\nimplies EON is inversely proportional to structural com-\n\nplexity. Navigational aids help the user to navigate easily\n\nthrough the website. The sites were rated on the presence\n\nof these navigational aids on \u2018Yes\u2019 or \u2018No\u2019 scale.

As\n\nshownintheFig. 4. ThePagesize iscalculated using\n\nPingdom tool and 100 Mbps internet connection is taken\n\nfor the bandwidth. Round Trip time (RTT) which is de\ufb01ned\n\nas the difference of the time the \ufb01rst response is received at\n\nthe user end from the user browser and the time taken to\n\nsend the information from the user browser is measured\n\nusing \u2018\u2018ping\u2019\u2019 at the command prompt which is available\n\nwith all operating system. RTT may vary depending on\n\ngeographical location, traf\ufb01c internet and their choice of\n\nservice provider. Turns can be measured using the formu-\n\nlae shown in the Fig. 4and the number of objects. Server\n\nprocessing is directly measured under DNS using pingdom\n\ntool and the Client processing time is measured by the user\n\nusing stop watch.\n\nApart from the user inputs the technical property of the\n\nwebsite are also important characteristic on which the\n\nperformance of the website should be measured. Response\n\nTime, security, accessibility or availability of the website\n\nare some standard features along with the size and com-\n\nplexity which has already being discussed in EON. For\n\ninstitutes website which is more commonly used for dis-\n\nplaying the information, Excess speed i.e. how fast a\n\nwebsite can download its pages is critical as the user \ufb01rst\n\nvisits the home page. In this study, we have only consid-\n\nered the response time for the home page however it can be\n\nextended to the display of successive pages also. Com-\n\nbining all the factors on which response time depends, the\n\nRT for all the six websites are shown in Table 5.\n\n5Usability evaluation\n\nIn the current section, the usability of six academic web-\n\nsites of higher education (U1\u2026U6) is taken as a case study\n\nand is evaluated based on the above mentioned four cri-\n\nteria. Each criteria is evaluated independently using\n\nrespective equation given in Sect. 4as shown in Tables 2,\n\n3,4and 5. The cumulative matrix for the four criteria is\n\nshown in Table 6.\n\nTo calculate the objective weights for the criteria,\n\nnotably EOU and INF that are taken as subjective criteria.\n\nReferringTables 2and 3, the highest value in a row is\n\nTable 4Easeof navigation\n\nWebsiteIOCNavigational aidsEON\n\nU10.102907 10.551454\n\nU20.121547 0.60.360774\n\nU30.122308 0.80.461154\n\nU40.122788 0.80.461394\n\nU50.078921 0.60.339461\n\nU60.960784 0.80.880392\n\nResponse time\n\nRound Trip\n\ntime \\* Turns\n\n(RTT) (II)\n\nPage size and\n\nband width(I)\n\nServer\n\nProcessing\n\nTime(III)\n\nClient\n\nProcessing\n\nTime(IV)\n\nPage size /\n\nband width\n\nRTT\n\nusing\n\nPing\n\nTurns=4+\n\n(3\\* No.of\n\nobjects)/4\n\nDomain\n\nName\n\nServer\n\nusing\n\nPingdom\n\ntool\n\nStop\n\nWatch\n\nFig. 4Response time\n\nTable 5Response time\n\nWebsite IIIIIIIVRT\n\nU10.0391.6950.337 3.5 5.57\n\nU20.008239 2.880.528 6.3 9.72\n\nU30.0172.1655 0.263 5.1 7.55\n\nU40.009121.3950.304 1.2 2.91\n\nU50.0253.1625 0.285 3.3 6.77\n\nU60.0152.9575 0.077 5.6 8.65\n\nTable 6Original matrix for differentcriteria\n\nEOUINFEON RT\n\nU1 3.4253.812857 0.551454 5.57\n\nU2 3.0166667 2.632857 0.360774 9.72\n\nU3 2.2766667 2.984286 0.461154 7.55\n\nU4 2.7783333 2.437071 0.461394 2.91\n\nU5 2.332.887857 0.339461 6.77\n\nU6 2.5766667 2.9450.880392 8.65\n\nInt J Syst Assur Eng Manag\n\n123\n\nAuthor's personal copy\n\ntaken as (\u2018u\u2019), the average value calculated is as taken as\n\n(\u2018m\u2019) and the lowest value is taken as (\u2018l\u2019).

(5),\n\n(6) the subjective weights calculated is shown in\n\nTable 9.\n\nIt is very clear that when RT increases, usability\n\ndecreases. So, RT is considered as cost criteria and with the\n\nincrease of EON, INF and EOU, the usability increases, so\n\nEON, INF and EOU are considered as bene\ufb01t criteria. To\n\nobtain the combined weights Table 7is again normalized\n\nwith respect to cost and bene\ufb01t criteria as per Eqs.(7), (8),\n\nshown in Table 10.\n\nFinally the combination weights is determined using\n\ncombination weighting method (Eq.(10)). Comparison of\n\nobjective,subjectiveandcombinedweightsTable 11 is\n\nshown in Fig. 5.\n\nThe proposed usability metric given in Eq. (11) is used\n\nto evaluate the usability of six website. The weights for\n\nvarious criteria calculated using combined approachis\n\ntaken from Table 11 and the usability for the six websites\n\nof academic institutes of higher education is given as\n\nUsability \u00bc0:1361 \ue005EOU \u00fe0:15356 \ue005INF \u00fe0:43656\n\n\ue005EON \u00fe0:27378 \ue005RT \u00f013\u00de\n\nUsingEq.

Therefore, small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs) should use technology in their product sales processes to become more competitive in the global market. This article will evaluate fresh food product e-commerce websites to see which one performs better in terms of usability. These parameters are investigated based on numerous research findings and the website attributes. To compare the outcomes, the evaluation was carried out using two alternative methods: fuzzy AHP and fuzzy TOPSIS. Fuzzy AHP results and analysis were used to determine the weights of the main and sub-factors, while Fuzzy TOPSIS was used to determine the ranking of alternatives. A Triangular Fuzzy Number (TFN) deals with poor assessments in biased judgments. The result from this study shows that the best website usability is website-1 because it closely follows crucial factors compared to the other two websites. The Website-3 comes in second, followed by the Website-2. Website-1 had the highest relative closeness score (0.5333), indicating that Website-1 has the best usability level among the three websites examined in this study. With a relative closeness of 0.5143, Website-3 came in second. Website-2 received the lowest score (0.5012), indicating that it has the least application of the critical success characteristics required for a fresh food product e-commerce website with the best usability level.\\\n\\\n[View](publication/373514220_USABILITY_WEBSITE_EVALUATION_FOR_FRESH_FOOD_PRODUCT_IN_SME'S_ONLINE_BUSINESS_WITH_FUZZY_AHP-TOPSIS_INTEGRATION)\\\n\\\nShow abstract\\\n\\\n...

In particular, smartphones, tablets and other handheld devices equipped with mobile applications have changed every aspect of our lives. Today, a user can choose from nearly five million applications available for both Android and iOS operating systems. However, only 0.5 percent of applications succeed in the marketplace. Many factors contribute to their failure, including poor design, lack of value, privacy violations, and usability issues. While usability is often identified as a major concern, there seems to be no agreement between researchers and practitioners on its nature, although many models have been developed. This paper attempts to find a consensus by synthesizing the state of the art literature. More specifically, we aim to develop a consolidated, universal usability model for mobile applications, through the lens of existing human computer interaction theory. In order to achieve this goal, our study uses a mix of qualitative and quantitative methods. Overall, the research methodology consisted of two steps. First, we conducted a systematic literature review to identify, collect, and analyze current research on mobile usability. Second, we used the meta-analysis approach to quantitatively describe the extracted data and summarize the findings. The PACMAD+3 model was developed and discussed in light of the results obtained and the PACMAD model. While our model borrows seven attributes from its ancestor, the remaining three attributes were derived from the synthesis of other studies, along with three external factors adopted from the ISO 9241-11 standard. In addition, we reviewed existing definitions of usability attributes. We expect that this unified approach will lead to a better understanding of mobile usability, including all relevant attributes and factors, thus making a significant contribution to theory. On the other hand, in practice, the PACMAD+3 model can be used to translate abstract attributes into tangible terms, which is particularly useful in empirical research focused on measuring and evaluating the usability of mobile applications.\\\n\\\n[View](publication/380244076_Usability_of_mobile_applications_A_consolidated_model)\\\n\\\nShow abstract\\\n\\\n...

Compared with offline teachers, it is difficult for online teachers to capture the learning status of students in the whole class, and it is even more difficult to continue to pay attention to students while teaching. Therefore, this paper proposes an online learning state analysis model based on a convolutional neural network and multi-dimensional information fusion. Specifically, a facial expression recognition model and an eye state recognition model are constructed to detect students\u2019 emotions and fatigue, respectively. By integrating the detected data with the homework test score data after online learning, an analysis model of students\u2019 online learning status is constructed. According to the PAD model, the learning state is expressed as three dimensions of students\u2019 understanding, engagement and interest, and then analyzed from multiple perspectives. Finally, the proposed model is applied to actual teaching, and procedural analysis of 5 different types of online classroom learners is carried out, and the validity of the model is verified by comparing with the results of the manual analysis.\\\n\\\n[View](publication/366766056_An_Analysis_Model_of_Learners'_Online_Learning_Status_Based_on_Deep_Neural_Network_and_Multi-Dimensional_Information_Fusion)\\\n\\\nShow abstract\\\n\\\n...

Therefore, we evaluated the safety of oil depots based on four factors in this study: personnel, equipment and facility, environment, and resilience. Complex networks, analytic hierarchy processes, and information entropy theory were used to establish an evaluation index system including four first-level indicators, nine second-level indicators, and 40 third-level indicators. Scores of 40 evaluation indicators were taken as the input, a vulnerability level of oil depots affected by heavy rain was gained as the output, and results were presented visually (different warning levels distinguished by color) to help oil depot enterprises improve their safety performance under extreme weather conditions.\\\n\\\n[View](publication/361140645_A_Risk_Evaluation_Method_of_Coastal_Oil_Depots_for_Heavy_Rainfall_Vulnerability_Assessment)\\\n\\\nShow abstract\\\n\\\n...

The tight sandstone reservoir is characterized by low porosity and low permeability, which requires hydraulic fracturing to improve industrial productivity. In this study, a systematic model was proposed for the fracability evaluation of tight sandstone reservoirs. The rock mechanics tests and sonic tests demonstrated that tight sandstone reservoir is characterized by high brittleness, high fracture toughness, and weak development of natural fractures. Numerical simulation was used to analyze the change of reservoir parameters during hydraulic fracturing and the influence of in situ stress on fracture propagation. The results showed that when the horizontal stress anisotropy coefficient is small, natural fractures may lead hydraulic fractures to change direction, and complex fracture networks are easily formed in the reservoir. The horizontal stress anisotropy coefficient ranges from 0.23 to 0.52, and it is easy to produce fracture networks in the reservoir. A new fracability evaluation model was established based on the analytic hierarchy process (AHP). The fracability of tight sandstone reservoir is characterized by the fracability index (FI) and is divided into three levels. Based on the model, this study carried out fracability evaluation and fracturing zone optimization in the study area, and the microseismic monitoring results verified the accuracy of the model.\\\n\\\n[View](publication/354825238_Fracability_Evaluation_Method_and_Influencing_Factors_of_the_Tight_Sandstone_Reservoir)\\\n\\\nShow abstract\\\n\\\n...

In this paper, the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation for water quality was improved by using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and Entropy, and a health risk assessment model based on triangular fuzzy theory was developed. The evaluation results show 5 water categories: Class-1 (n = 1, 2%), Class-2 (n = 14, 32%), Class-3 (n = 15, 34%), Class-4 (n = 8, 18%) and Class-5 (n = 6, 14%), manifesting about 67% of the phreatic water can be used for drinking purposes in the research area.

Compare with adults, children undertake higher health risk, in research area. Particularly, the region accepting Class-5 water supplement encounter high non-carcinogenic risk, where risk level is 2.24 and 2.28 times to the average risk level for adults and children, respectively.

To date, only a few studies have focused on hydraulic fracturing in hydrate-bearing sediments. However, the numerous factors that affect fracture initiation and propagation are not clearly understood, and the fracability of non-diagenetic geo-materials has not been systematically evaluated. In this study, a series of true triaxial hydraulic fracturing experiments are conducted on clayey-silty hydrate-bearing sediments to investigate the effects of the key reservoir and engineering parameters on fracture initiation and propagation. Based on the resulting data, a fracability index (FI) that considers multiple factors is developed using a novel method. The results indicate that fracture initiation pressure does not always increase with increasing hydrate saturation. Moreover, a maximum value of 14.92 MPa for the initiation pressure is observed at 40% hydrate saturation. This value is increased by 20.51 MPa when the effective horizontal in-situ stress increases from 1 to 4 MPa, which is in contrast to the tensile crack initiation law of elastic rocks. Additionally, owing to the inhomogeneous hydrate in sediments, fractures expand unevenly, and double fractures are able to form in an isotropic horizontal stress state. The horizontal stress difference is the primary parameter (weight 0.4) that governs the FI, followed by the coefficient of earth pressure at rest (weight 0.31), fracture toughness (weight 0.18), and hydrate saturation (weight 0.05), and vertical in-situ stress (weight 0.05). Increasing the injection rate and fracturing fluid viscosity is an effective method to promote fracture propagation, particularly when Q\u03bc\u00af> 0.33 (defined by the normalised injection rate and fracturing fluid viscosity) and FI> 0.4. In such conditions, a considerable reconstruction area can be obtained.\\\n\\\n[View](publication/362714056_Experimental_study_on_hydraulic_fracturing_in_clayey-silty_hydrate-bearing_sediments_and_fracability_evaluation_based_on_multilayer_perceptron-analytic_hierarchy_process)\\\n\\\nShow abstract\\\n\\\n[OSWMI: An Objective-Subjective Weighted method for Minimizing Inconsistency in multi-criteria decision making](publication/360510160_OSWMI_An_Objective-Subjective_Weighted_method_for_Minimizing_Inconsistency_in_multi-criteria_decision_making)\\\n\\\nArticle\\\n\\\nFull-text available\\\n\\\n- May 2022\\\n- COMPUT IND ENG\\\n\\\n- [![Arup Ratan Paramanik](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAADUlEQVR42mN89OjNfwAJDwOxHEacwgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)Arup Ratan Paramanik](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Arup-Ratan-Paramanik)\\\n- [![Sobhan Sarkar](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAADUlEQVR42mN89OjNfwAJDwOxHEacwgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)Sobhan Sarkar](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sobhan-Sarkar)\\\n- [![Bijan Sarkar](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAADUlEQVR42mN89OjNfwAJDwOxHEacwgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)Bijan Sarkar](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Bijan-Sarkar)\\\n\\\nIn Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM), alternatives are evaluated by considering different criteria. In MCDM, there is a requirement to integrate the objective and subjective weights, since the objective weighting methods ignore the decision-maker\u2019s (DM\u2019s) experiences and the subjective weighting methods ignore the performance ratings of the alternatives with respect to different criteria. To integrate the two types of weights and evaluate the best alternative, three well-established methods, namely \u201cCRiteria Importance Through Intercriteria Correlation (CRITIC)\u201d, \u201cBest Worst Method (BWM)\u201d, and \u201cLINear programming techniques for Multidimensional Analysis of Preferences (LINMAP)\u201d are considered in our study. Based on these methods, we have proposed a new method, namely \u201cObjective-Subjective Weighted method for Minimizing Inconsistency (OSWMI)\u201d which considers both pairwise comparisons of the criteria and alternatives along with their corresponding performance ratings. We have first improved both the methods, CRITIC (named as improved CRITIC) and LINMAP (named as LINMAP II). Finally, the proposed OSWMI method is developed by integrating the improved CRITIC method, BWM, and LINMAP II using a multi-objective non-linear programming (MONLP) model. The OSWMI method may reduce the problem of strategic weight manipulation, since the integrated weights and the two ideal solutions are priori unknown and obtained simultaneously for selecting the best alternative. A case study of the web service selection is used to demonstrate the implementation of the OSWMI method. From the analysis, the proposed OSWMI method reveals a promising result. Further, sensitivity of the OSWMI method is checked by using the standard regression coefficients obtained by multiple linear regression.\\\n\\\n[View](publication/360510160_OSWMI_An_Objective-Subjective_Weighted_method_for_Minimizing_Inconsistency_in_multi-criteria_decision_making)\\\n\\\nShow abstract\\\n\\\n[AHP-TOPS\u0130S Y\u00d6NTEMLER\u0130YLE E-T\u0130CARET S\u0130TELER\u0130N\u0130N PERFORMANSLARININ KAR\u015eILA\u015eTIRILMASI](publication/359761364_AHP-TOPSIS_YONTEMLERIYLE_E-TICARET_SITELERININ_PERFORMANSLARININ_KARSILASTIRILMASI)\\\n\\\nChapter\\\n\\\nFull-text available\\\n\\\n- Mar 2022\\\n\\\n- [![Kamil \u00c7elik](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAADUlEQVR42mN89OjNfwAJDwOxHEacwgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)Kamil \u00c7elik](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kamil-Celik-2)\\\n\\\n[View](publication/359761364_AHP-TOPSIS_YONTEMLERIYLE_E-TICARET_SITELERININ_PERFORMANSLARININ_KARSILASTIRILMASI)\\\n\\\n[Task and user-based Entropy-Rank Sum-TPOP integration proposal for usability evaluation of web applications](publication/358471126_Task_and_user-based_Entropy-Rank_Sum-TPOP_integration_proposal_for_usability_evaluation_of_web_applications)\\\n\\\nArticle\\\n\\\n- Feb 2022\\\n\\\n- [![Muhammet Yorulmaz](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAADUlEQVR42mN89OjNfwAJDwOxHEacwgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)Muhammet Yorulmaz](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Muhammet-Yorulmaz)\\\n- [G\u00fclin Feryal Can](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Guelin-Feryal-Can-2214423557)\\\n\\\nThe present study aims to determine the importance weights of the subjective and objective usability criteria based on task and user by considering these criteria simultaneously in the usability analysis of web applications. In this context, by proposing a Multi-criteria Decision Making approach including Entropy-Rank Sum (RS) \u2013 Technique of Precise Order Preference (TPOP) integration, the Multi-Dimensional Usability Analysis (MDUA) approach was advanced. The proposed analysis approach was applied on MOODLE software selected as a sample web application. The objective criteria in the sample application were measured using the Morae V3 program as a result of users performing their predefined tasks, and the subjective criteria were evaluated by determining the importance orders of the criteria for each user that affect the users' satisfaction. Subsequently, objective criteria weights were calculated by the Entropy method on task basis, and subjective criteria weights were computed by the RS method on user basis. In the last stage, the weights of the objective criteria and the weights of the subjective criteria that change according to the user are combined separately using the TPOP method. Thus, the most important subjective and objective criteria for improving the usability of MOODLE LMS were determined.\\\n\\\n[View](publication/358471126_Task_and_user-based_Entropy-Rank_Sum-TPOP_integration_proposal_for_usability_evaluation_of_web_applications)\\\n\\\nShow abstract\\\n\\\nShow more\\\n\\\n[How to Make a Decision: The Analytic Hierarchy Process](publication/307800676_How_to_Make_a_Decision_The_Analytic_Hierarchy_Process)\\\n\\\nArticle\\\n\\\nFull-text available\\\n\\\n- Mar 1994\\\n\\\n- [T.L.

This is resulted in designing of a complex and gigantic website which may result in slow download and unfriendly navigation. Satisfying the end user need is one of the key principles of designing an effective website. As there are different users for given website, hence there are different criteria on which user wants to get satisfied, hence evaluating a website is a multi-criteria decision making problem. In order to incorporate uncertainties and vagueness in decision making Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy (FAHP) approach is extended with Fuzzy TOPSIS approach, where different decision makers (DM's) opinion was considered for ranking the website.\\\n\\\n[View](publication/271831947_Rank_University_Websites_Using_Fuzzy_AHP_and_Fuzzy_TOPSIS_Approach_on_Usability)\\\n\\\nShow abstract\\\n\\\n[ANFIS Method for Usability Assessment of Website of an Educational Institute](publication/271831889_ANFIS_Method_for_Usability_Assessment_of_Website_of_an_Educational_Institute)\\\n\\\nArticle\\\n\\\nFull-text available\\\n\\\n- Jan 2013\\\n\\\n- [![Renuka Nagpal](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAADUlEQVR42mN89OjNfwAJDwOxHEacwgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)Renuka Nagpal](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Renuka-Nagpal)\\\n- [![Deepti Mehrotra](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAADUlEQVR42mN89OjNfwAJDwOxHEacwgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)Deepti Mehrotra](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Deepti-Mehrotra)\\\n- [![Arun Sharma](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAADUlEQVR42mN89OjNfwAJDwOxHEacwgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)Arun Sharma](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Arun-Sharma-38)\\\n- [![Pradeep Kumar Bhatia](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAADUlEQVR42mN89OjNfwAJDwOxHEacwgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)Pradeep Kumar Bhatia](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Pradeep-Bhatia-2)\\\n\\\nToday website is considered as an image of an organization.

The intelligent home system creates the more comfortable, safer, humane and intelligent living environment. It can resolve the problems facing by the people who have busy schedules and get a very less amount of time to spend at home which is increasing rapidly around the world. For the solution of this problem, user can depend on the automated machines and gadgets like smart phones. These smart gadgets are using cloud computing which sends and receives signal o the cloud. The data that is of our use can be fetched by matching some key values using the concept of information retrieval. The key objective of this paper is to create a full-fledged application which could let user to operate the lights of their house from any remote location. The user have a list of options to select which light is to be on and when. The only requirement is to have working wifi at home to which the lights are connected. The is developed in Lua Language by using the Esplorer Integrated Development Environment (IDE). We have also used the micro controller chip ESP 8266 to build our board.\n\n**Published in:** [2016 6th International Conference - Cloud System and Big Data Engineering (Confluence)](/xpl/conhome/7503213/proceeding)\n\n**Date of Conference:** 14-15 January 2016\n\n**Date Added to IEEE _Xplore_:** 09 July 2016\n\n**ISBN Information:**\n\n**DOI:** [10.1109/CONFLUENCE.2016.7508211](https://doi.org/10.1109/CONFLUENCE.2016.7508211)\n\nPublisher: IEEE\n\n**Conference Location:** Noida, India\n\n![](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/assets/img/document/toc-icon.png) Contents\n\n* * *\n\n### I.

So much researches have been going through focusing on machine to machine correspondence where gadgets or machines are intelligently communicating with each other. The working of IOT can be done in two different ways\\[1\\] that can be explained as: it gathers all the information that are basic for resources such as its name, address, etc and its linked attributes using some automatic classification, sensors and the position of satellite and by the assistance of all existing communication technologies as it can combine objects-related details into information network and comprehend the intelligent indexing and incorporation of information related to ample of objects. Finally the information can be analyze and process by using smart computing techniques such as cloud computing, fuzzy recognition, semantic analysis and data mining.\n\n[Sign in to Continue Reading](javascript:void())\n\nAuthors\n\nFigures\n\nReferences\n\nCitations\n\nKeywords\n\nMetrics\n\nMore Like This\n\n[A study of integration Internet of Things with health level 7 protocol for real-time healthcare monitoring by using cloud computing](/document/8229134/)\n\n2017 10th Biomedical Engineering International Conference (BMEiCON)\n\nPublished: 2017\n\n[An Efficient and Provably Secure Certificateless Protocol for Industrial Internet of Things](/document/9729405/)\n\nIEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics\n\nPublished: 2022\n\n[Show More](javascript:void())\n\n**References is not available for this document.**\n\n### IEEE Account\n\n- [Change Username/Password](https://www.ieee.org/profile/changeusrpwd/showChangeUsrPwdPage.html?refSite=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org&refSiteName=IEEE Xplore)\n- [Update Address](https://www.ieee.org/profile/address/getAddrInfoPage.html?refSite=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org&refSiteName=IEEE Xplore)\n\n### Purchase Details\n\n- [Payment Options](https://www.ieee.org/profile/payment/showPaymentHome.html?refSite=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org&refSiteName=IEEE Xplore)\n- [Order History](https://www.ieee.org/profile/vieworder/showOrderHistory.html?refSite=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org&refSiteName=IEEE Xplore)\n- [View Purchased Documents](/articleSale/purchaseHistory.jsp)\n\n### Profile Information\n\n- [Communications Preferences](https://www.ieee.org/ieee-privacyportal/app/ibp?refSite=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org&refSiteName=IEEE Xplore)\n- [Profession and Education](https://www.ieee.org/profile/profedu/getProfEduInformation.html?refSite=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org&refSiteName=IEEE Xplore)\n- [Technical Interests](https://www.ieee.org/profile/tips/getTipsInfo.html?refSite=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org&refSiteName=IEEE Xplore)\n\n### Need Help?\n\n- **US & Canada:** +1 800 678 4333\n- **Worldwide:** +1 732 981 0060\n\n- [Contact & Support](/xpl/contact)\n\n- [About IEEE _Xplore_](/Xplorehelp/overview-of-ieee-xplore/about-ieee-xplore)\n- [Contact Us](/xpl/contact)\n- [Help](/Xplorehelp)\n- [Accessibility](/Xplorehelp/overview-of-ieee-xplore/accessibility-statement)\n- [Terms of Use](/Xplorehelp/overview-of-ieee-xplore/terms-of-use)\n- [Nondiscrimination Policy](http://www.ieee.org/web/aboutus/whatis/policies/p9-26.html)\n- [Sitemap](/xpl/sitemap.jsp)\n- [Privacy & Opting Out of Cookies](http://www.ieee.org/about/help/security_privacy.html)\n\nA not-for-profit organization, IEEE is the world's largest technical professional organization dedicated to advancing technology for the benefit of humanity.\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2024 IEEE - All rights reserved.

The authors posit that educational websites are critical platforms for various stakeholders, including students, parents, and faculty, and as such, their usability is an essential quality that must be assessed through a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach. Traditional Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) methods are noted for their limitations in handling uncertainty, thus advocating for the use of FAHP to incorporate fuzzy logic into the decision-making process.\n\nThe study identifies significant usability parameters such as ease of use, navigation, information relevancy, response time, and various subjective measures, highlighting how these metrics cater to the differing requirements of site visitors. The paper also evaluates multiple educational websites from the National Capital Region of India, taking into consideration the homogeneous characteristics of their user base. The FAHP methodology empowers decision-makers to weight usability criteria effectively and rank the websites accordingly, leading to higher usability scores for the best sites.\n\nResults from the empirical study place W2 as the top-ranked educational website with a usability score of 89%, followed by W4 at 87%. The findings are geared towards improving user satisfaction and providing actionable insights for educational institutions to enhance their website design and usability. The article concludes that the FAHP method affords better decision-making processes and aligns design decisions with user needs more effectively than traditional methods.",

These websites\n\nare frequently visited by students, parents aspiring students and their parents, university faculties and other personnel and many other\n\nvisitors who want to know about the organization. Usability of these websites will have different dimensions for different users.\n\nHence broadly, measuring usability of website is a Multi criteria decision making problem (MCDM). Analytic hierarchy Process\n\n(AHP) approach has been considered a common solution to these problems. However, to handle uncertainty of the judgment Fuzzy\n\nAnalytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) is used. In this paper, different websites of an educational institute are compared and ranked on\n\ntheir usability criteria using FAHP.\n\nKeywords:Usability,Website,FAHP,MCDM\n\n1.INTRODUCTION\n\nToday website is considered as lifeline of any\n\norganization. Website is primarily used as a virtual image\n\nand promotional platform of the organization that display\n\nall features and facility of the organization. With\n\nincreasing internet usage websites are becoming an\n\nintegral part of all business process and usually all\n\nbusiness application processes are linked with web portal\n\nof organization. The user centric approach if used in\n\ndeveloping the website will definitely improve the utility\n\nof the website and overall success of the organization.\n\nThe usability of a website is directly related with the\n\ngrowth of any business organization along with other\n\nparameters such as reliability and security of website.\n\nUsability of website depends upon wide range of\n\nparameters like ease of use, ease of navigation,\n\nattractiveness, informative, accessibility, design etc. As\n\ndifferent organization have different business\n\nrequirement and end users hence standardization of\n\nusability metrics for all projects based on same criteria is\n\nnot justifiable. The website usability and design has\n\nattracted much attention in the fields of human computer\n\ninteraction. Designing a website giving more attention to\n\nthe fact like \u201cwho will be the visitors\u201d, \u201cwhat information\n\nis searched\u201d and \u201chow this information is retrieved easily\n\nand timely\u201d, will improve the overall effectiveness of the\n\nwebsite.\n\nUsability of website can have both subjective as well\n\nas objective measures like user satisfaction, experience,\n\nnavigation, pattern, download time and accessibility etc.\n\nThese measurements are done after the launch of the\n\nwebsite through feedback or through different tools. For\n\noverall increase effectiveness of a website it is required\n\nto usability prediction and estimation at each stage of the\n\nwebsite design. Thus along with requirement analysis a\n\nusability analysis also need to be done in the initial stage\n\nof web designing. Keeping in view the users and business\n\nneed \\[1\\] tried to identify the parameters which are most\n\nimportant for given website, depending on the user\n\nfeedback collected from wide range of user who will\n\npossibly visit the website frequently. A rule set should be\n\ndesigned so that the usability of the website can be\n\nmeasured as per the requirement laid. While designing\n\nthe websites its usability need to be evaluated using user\n\ninterface models, navigational models, technological\n\nplatforms, database schemas etc.The prime objective is\n\nuser satisfaction, as users have wide range of choices and\n\ncognitive approach to access the website. Hence user\n\nfeedback is considered beneficial to provide guidelines\n\nand frameworks for making the pleasing user experiences\n\nin such systems \\[2\\].The most common usability\n\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.12785/ijcds/040404\n\n252Renuka Nagpal, et. al.: FAHP Approach to rank educational websites on Usability\n\nhttp://journals.uob.edu.bh\n\nmeasurement approaches concerns the user attitude and\n\nview especially towards the interface through which it\n\ninteracts via the interface and possible outcomes. To\n\nobtain this input large variety of questionnaires are being\n\ndesigned, however these techniques are dependent upon\n\nthe user feedback and the type of users and their\n\nexperience. Technically experts can provide a better\n\ninsight about the website and incorporating their opinion\n\nand decision making will definitely enhance the usability\n\nof website.\n\nAs the web usability incorporates both tangible and\n\nintangible measures hence it can be regarded as multi\n\ncriteria decision making (MCDM) problem. As discussed\n\nabove the usability is not a single property but a\n\ncombination of several properties and attributes, that is\n\nthere are many criteria\u2019s that influence the usability of\n\nthe website. These criteria\u2019s can be conflicting in nature\n\nlike if the aesthetics of website need to be improved\n\nmany images and videos can be incorporated which may\n\nin turn increase the download time. To have an effective\n\nwebsite it is important to determine the criteria that will\n\ninfluence the website quality and need to be focused most\n\nby the website designers \\[3\\]. Identifying the most crucial\n\ncriteria Analytic Hierarchy Approach (AHP) can be used\n\nthat allow the importance ranking to the criteria\u2019s\n\n(weights) and alternatives, options can be compared\n\nbased on the set multilevel criteria. However the AHP\n\napproach is often criticized for representing the personal\n\njudgments with crisp values. In actual practice the use of\n\nfuzzy set helps the decision maker to incorporate the\n\nunquantifiable, incomplete and unobtainable information\n\ninto the decision model. In the case of a website\n\nparameters like ease of use and user satisfaction are\n\nunquantifiable. Further there is always a chance of\n\nuncertainty and incomplete information extraction with\n\nsuch a large number of end users hence fuzzy based\n\napproach prove to be more effective solution for\n\nassigning the weight to the criteria and evaluating the\n\nalternatives.\n\nLike other industries the websites are becoming the\n\nkey entry point for the aspiring students and their parents\n\nto select an educational organization. As the online\n\ntechnologies has become a key source for information\n\nretrieval there is need to have a reliable, informative and\n\neffective website which can cater the need of wide range\n\nof viewers. Further these websites provides many\n\nfeatures like online attendance, marks verification etc.\n\nwhich are the integral component of education process.\n\nBlending the user\u2019s satisfaction and the need of education\n\nprocesses (admission regular monitoring, examination\n\netc.) made the website designing a complex process.\n\nThus measuring the effectiveness of website by merely\n\ncounting the hits on the pages or onlyone criterion like\n\nease of navigation etc. is not accurate. Hence there is a\n\nneed to use an effective usability measurement technique\n\nwhich can suffix MCDM approach for these websites. In\n\nthis paper FAHP, a MCDM technique is used to rank\n\nsome popular educational websites in the National\n\nCapital Region (NCR) of India. These websites are\n\nassociated with technical higher education and hence\n\nhave a more or less similar type of user and similar\n\nenvironment. In this paperFAHP approach has been\n\napplied to study the usability of the educational website\n\nand for making a decision that which website is most\n\nusable depending on user experience, below steps are\n\nperformed:\n\n\uf0b7\n\nIdentifying and evaluating attributes on which the\n\nusability of the website depends.\n\n\uf0b7\n\nEvaluating the alternatives web site and rank them\n\nbased on the given criteria.\n\n2.LITERATURE REVIEWTO IDENTIFY THE\n\nPARAMETERS USE TO MEASURE THE WEBSITE\n\nThe concept of usability is widely discussed in various\n\ndimensions in software industry \\[4\\] \\[5\\]. For the web\n\nindustry great amount of research has been performed for\n\nmeasuring and benchmarking the usability of the website\n\n\\[6\\] \\[7\\]. Different definitions have been proposed based\n\non ISO 9241- 11\\[8\\] standard says usability is: \"The\n\nextent towhich a product can be used by specified users\n\nto achieve specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency\n\nand satisfaction in a specified context of use\u201d. One of the\n\nmost widely accepted definition of usability was\n\nintroduced by Nielsen \\[9\\]. According to \\[9\\] the\n\ncomponents of usability are Learnability, Efficiency,\n\nMemorability, few errors, users\u2019 satisfaction. Navigation,\n\ndownload speed, content relevance, ease of use,\n\naccessibility and availability are some key parameters\n\nthat affect the usability of the website. Although for\n\ntourism industries aesthetics, for e-commerce site\n\nsecurity, for stock market and news websites latest\n\ninformation and speed are the prime parameters. Thus\n\ndifferent industries have different requirement but certain\n\nimportant parameters needto be identified that prove\n\nuseful for different range of websites to name a few are\n\ngiven below in Table \\[1\\]. It can be easily seen that\n\nnavigation, content, download time, ease of use and\n\navailability are the most important parameters used in\n\nliterature for measuring usability.\n\nThere are various techniques for evaluating the usability\n\nwhich includes \\[10\\] \\[11\\]\n\nTesting methods\n\n\uf0b7Think Aloud Protocol-where users think while\n\nperforming a task\n\n\uf0b7Performance Measurement-using software tools\n\nand obtaining statistics\n\n\uf0b7Log Analysis- analyzing the usage pattern from\n\nthe web logs\n\nThese techniques are not user friendly and time\n\nconsuming.\n\nInt. J. Com. Dig. Sys. 4, No.4, 251-260 (Oct-2015)253\n\nhttp://journals.uob.edu.bh\n\nInspection Methods\n\n\uf0b7Cognitive Walkthrough-experts examine the\n\nuser\u2019sgoal achievement by performing a group\n\nof task.\n\n\uf0b7Heuristic evaluation-finds the usabilityin user\n\ninterface\n\n\uf0b7Perspective based inspection-experts inspects\n\nthe design perspective and evaluated\n\n\uf0b7Guideline Review-verify the usability by setting\n\nup the guidelines.\n\nIn these approaches experts are the evaluators and\n\nthey evaluate the website on certain set parameters.\n\nInquiry Methods\n\n\uf0b7Questionnaires and Interviews-collecting the\n\nfeedback from the user for measuring the user\n\nsatisfaction.\n\n\uf0b7Focus Group-where multiple user participate for\n\nevaluation.\n\nThe validity of this approach depends upon the\n\ncollected data as well as user participation.\n\nOne of the major challenges in above techniqueis\n\nthat often websites have a wide range of visitors few are\n\nwell versed with the technology and some are novice.\n\nEspecially the university website is used by both students\n\nwhich are well trained and parents who are still not very\n\ncomfortable with the technology. For both trained and\n\nuntrained users setting up usability goals so that designer\n\ncan meet the user expectation and provide the website\n\nwith best possible performance is the desired task. Inputs\n\nfrom the expert designers who can critically analyze the\n\nwhole scenario and compare various parameters as\n\ndiscussed in Table \\[1\\] can lead to an effective website.\n\nAnother major challenge \\[36\\] for designing a model to\n\nmeasure the usability of the website is to design\n\nquestions and measure both objective and subjective\n\nusability aspect which includes outcomes effectiveness\n\n(interaction process(efficiency),user attitude and\n\nexperience(user satisfaction). Selecting the parameters\n\nthat can measure the effectiveness, efficiency and user\n\nsatisfaction directly or indirectly and rating importance of\n\nthese parameters will prove a useful study for measuring\n\nthe usability of the website.\n\nHence MCDM approach can be suitably used for\n\nmeasuring web usability. The MCDM problem involves\n\ndecision making in the presence of multiple, usually\n\nconflicting criteria.MCDM problems are common in\n\neveryday life. In general, there exist two distinctive types\n\nof MCDM problems due to the different problems\n\nsettings: one type having a finite number of alternative\n\nsolutions and the other an infinite number of solutions.\n\nNormally in problems associated with selection and\n\nassessment, the number of alternative solutions is limited.\n\nIn problems related to design, an attribute may take\n\nany value in a range. Therefore the potential alternative\n\nsolutions could be infinite. If this is the case, the problem\n\nis referred to as multiple objective optimization problems\n\ninstead of multiple attribute decision problems \\[12\\]. In\n\nthis paperMCDM approach with finite number of\n\nsolutions is followed. Different approaches like AHP,\n\nCompromise Programming, TOPSIS (Technique for\n\nOrder Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution), and\n\nPROMETHEE-2 are available to solve such problem. In\n\norder to incorporate the importance of human judgment\n\nwhich is always subjective and imprecise the fuzzy\n\ntheory is incorporated in the AHP(FAHP). In this\n\napproach the decision makers evaluate the weights for the\n\ncriteria depending on the subjective judgment. Further\n\nthe alternatives can be prioritized depending on the given\n\nfactors. This approach has been widely used in various\n\ndomains like irrigation planning \\[13\\]Construction\n\nproject selection \\[14\\] Personnel Selection problem \\[15\\]\n\nlocation selection problem \\[16\\].\n\nIn this paper this approach is extended for ranking\n\neducational websites. A hierarchical framework for\n\nmeasuring usability in through FAHP technique is\n\nproposed for that the four most important criterias that\n\naffects the usability most for an educational websites\n\nwere identified.\n\n3.METHODOLOGY\n\nThe AHP proposed by Saaty \\[17\\] has been widely\n\nused in various kinds of MCDM problems. This approach\n\nis extended to FAHP by including fuzzy ratios instead of\n\nexact ratios to handle the uncertainty problems in\n\ndecision making \\[18\\].The fuzziness was introduced by\n\nZadeh \\[19\\] in order to deal with uncertainty of human\n\nthoughts.\n\nA.Fuzzy Sets\n\nThe fuzzy set theory can productively express\n\nindefinite information or individual perception using\n\nlinguistic terms.\n\nB. Linguistic variables\n\nAccording to Zadeh \\[20\\] linguistic variable are\n\nvariables whose values are represented in words or\n\nsentences in a natural or artificial language. Linguistic\n\nvariable are used in such situation that are complicated\n\nand hard to define.

Various selection criteria are involved\n\nfor evaluating the effectiveness of the website. In the\n\ncurrent discussion websites of different educational\n\ninstitutes (W1, W2, W3, and W4) are consideredas a\n\ncase study. Based on comprehensive survey \\[1\\] of the\n\nrelevant educational websitesfour parameters identified\n\nas selection criteria are Response Time (RT), Ease of use\n\n(EOU), Ease of Navigation (EON), Informative\n\n(INF).The hierarchical structure for evaluating the\n\nusability of website is given in Fig.\\[1\\].The four selection\n\ncriteria\u2019s and their corresponding fuzzy NPC matrix are\n\ngiven below:\n\nFigure1: Hierarchal Framework for evaluating the usability\n\nCriteria for\n\nUsability\n\nInformative\n\n(C4)\n\nEase of\n\nNavigation (C3)\n\nEase of Use (C2)\n\nResponse\n\nTime (C1)\n\nWebsite (W4)\n\nWebsite (W3)\n\nWebsite (W2)\n\nWebsite (W1)\n\nRanking of Websites\n\nDecision Maker\n\nInt.

The given\n\nwork examines the group decision making process and\n\nproposes the multicriteria framework for ranking the\n\neducational websites. Compared to usability evaluation\n\nusing user feedback FAHP provide faster and better\n\nresults using domain experts. It provides better decision\n\nmaking, flexibility, andability to check inconsistency\n\nand is able to handle hierarchies of criterias. To deal with\n\nthe qualitative attribute in subjective judgment, FAHP\n\napproach is employed that evaluate the weights of the\n\nparameters which are relatively important for the given\n\nwebsite. Four selected websites which are designed for\n\nsimilar environment usage (and similar visitor\n\n(educational website) are ranked based on the evaluated\n\nusability score. The work can be further extended for\n\nevaluation of website of any organization by identifying\n\nthe important parameters that need to be considered for\n\ndesigning given website.

The primary aim of this research project is to select and rank E-learning websites. The issue pertaining to the selection and ranking of e-learning platforms is addressed through the utilization of a methodology known as multiple-criteria decision-making (MCDM). The task of choosing E-learning websites is addressed through the application of the multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) technique known as Weighted-Combinative Distance-based Assessment (W-CODAS), which is specifically designed to tackle such issues. In order to assess the suitability and effectiveness of the proposed method, a comparison is made between the results obtained from methodology which is proposed and those obtained from established approaches such as Visekriterijumsko Kompromisno Rangiranje (VIKOR) and Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS).

This research aims to prioritize indicators for measuring employee well-being at the Oro Kopi Gayo company in conditions of uncertainty. Using Chang's Extent Analysis Method in the Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process, this paper evaluates five main components of employee well-being: work satisfaction, organizational respect for the employee, employer care, positive/negative emotions, and intrusion of work into private life. It is hoped that the results of this research can be used as a reference in further research to determine the influence of these five criteria on employee well-being at the Oro Kopi Gayo company.\n\n[View](publication/379050974_USING_FUZZY_ANALYTICAL_HIERARCHY_PROCESS_TO_PRIORITIZE_MEASUREMENT_INDICATORS_OF_EMPLOYEE_WELL-BEING_IN_ORO_KOPI_GAYO_COMPANY)\n\nShow abstract\n\n... Several researchers have argued that it is erroneous to fuzzify the AHP because the measurement scale itself, i.e., from one is equal to equal importance to nine is equal to extreme importance, implies the fuzzy concept \\[10,11\\] or asserts that FAHP leads to incorrect results \\[12\\]. However, they cannot stop the popularity of the FAHP and the application of the FAHP in various domains, e.g., education \\[13\\]\\[14\\]\\[15\\], and engineering \\[16\\]\\[17\\]\\[18\\].

However, the FAHP, unlike the AHP, easily handles the trusted weights by the consistency index (CI) or consistency ratio (CR). We need to first derive the consistent fuzzy pairwise comparison matrix (FPCM) by the transitivity axiom and then drive fuzzy weights. We also need a flexible mechanism for users to control the spread of fuzzy weights under tolerable consistency. In this paper, we propose a novel model based on mathematical programming to derive rational fuzzy weights of the FAHP and provide a parameter for decision-makers to control the spread of fuzzy weights. Three examples are used to demonstrate the proposed method and compared with others to validate and justify the proposed method.\n\n[View](publication/363868741_Deriving_Fuzzy_Weights_from_the_Consistent_Fuzzy_Analytic_Hierarchy_Process)\n\nShow abstract\n\n...

The fuzzy logic which paves the way for modeling human behaviors and expressing even vague concepts mathematically, and is also regarded as an artificial intelligence technique has become one of the most preferred methods in the solution of decision problems. Numerous decision-making situations are faced in education as well. Particularly, it is rather challenging and requires experience to decide in a fair way and assessing students' performances without making any error in the process of assessment and evaluation. The purpose of the current study is to assess students' performance with the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP), one of the multi-criteria decision making methods based on the fuzzy logic approach. The formation of the proposed system on the basis of fuzzy set theory determines that it can provide benefits in modeling these ambiguities in human mental processes and also it can reach fairer, more sensitive and objective results. Being used especially in making important decisions in companies and in developing smart vehicles in engineering, FAHP methods have brought into question whether this method can be used in education or not. This study reveals that FAHP method can be used in the evaluation of students' projects in education.\n\n[View](publication/360015088_An_application_of_fuzzy_analytic_hierarchy_process_FAHP_for_evaluating_students'_project)\n\nShow abstract\n\n...

These three components are affected by the developing and changing technology as a result of globalization considerably. Teaching and learning techniques should be updated and connected with these developments; new tools are therefore needed to make the necessary updates. Determination and application of the new tools include many decisions. Decision-makers can make more effective decisions using Multi-Criteria Decision-Making Techniques (MCDM), a complex decision-making tool that includes both quantitative and qualitative factors at present time. This study aimed to determine which MCDM methods are used in studies conducted in higher education, which is one of the most important development level indicators of countries, and to present a systematic literature review of MCDM method applications. The study was conducted in three stages: first, known electronics were searched until the end of 2021 using keywords; then, all studies were listed in a systematic taxonomy, and in the last stage, Thematic Network Analysis was used to evaluate the development of MCDM studies in the higher education area. It is determined that the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) method is the most widely used method in higher education in MCDM applications. It was observed that the most common use of MCDM applications in higher education is e-learning as well. This study aims to be a guide for all researchers and practitioners who will study in both higher education and the MCDM areas.\n\n[View](publication/369257738_A_systematic_literature_review_on_multi-criteria_decision_making_in_higher_educationA_systematic_literature_review_on_multi-criteria_decision_making_in_higher_education)\n\nShow abstract\n\n[Heuristic Evaluation Versus Guideline Reviews: A Tale of Comparing Two Domain Usability Expert's Evaluation Methods](publication/364188542_Heuristic_Evaluation_Versus_Guideline_Reviews_A_Tale_of_Comparing_Two_Domain_Usability_Expert's_Evaluation_Methods)\n\nArticle\n\n- Dec 2022\n\n- [![Sehrish Basir Nizamani](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAADUlEQVR42mN89OjNfwAJDwOxHEacwgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)Sehrish Basir Nizamani](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sehrish-Nizamani)\n- [![Saad Nizamani](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAADUlEQVR42mN89OjNfwAJDwOxHEacwgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)Saad Nizamani](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Saad-Nizamani-2)\n- [![Nazish Basir](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAADUlEQVR42mN89OjNfwAJDwOxHEacwgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)Nazish Basir](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Nazish-Basir-2)\n- [![Dr. Sarwat Nizamani](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAADUlEQVR42mN89OjNfwAJDwOxHEacwgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)Dr. Sarwat Nizamani](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Dr-Sarwat-Nizamani)\n\nbold xmlns:mml=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\" xmlns:xlink=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\"> Background:\nThe usability of university websites is important to ascertain that they serve their intended purpose. Their usability can be evaluated either by testing methods that rely on actual users or by inspection methods that rely on experts for evaluation. Heuristic evaluation and guideline reviews are two inspection methods of usability evaluation. A heuristic evaluation consists of a few general heuristics (rules), which are limited to checking general flaws in the design. A guideline review uses a much larger set of guidelines/suggestions that fit a specific business domain.\nLiterature review:\nMost of the literature has equated usability studies with testing methods and has given less focus to inspection methods. Moreover, those studies have examined usability in a general sense and not in domain- and culture-specific contexts.\nResearch questions:\n1\\. Do domain- and culture-specific heuristic evaluation and guideline reviews work similarly in evaluating the usability of applications? 2. Which of these methods is better in terms of the nature of evaluation, time needed for evaluation, evaluation procedure, templates adopted, and evaluation results? 3. Which method is better in terms of thoroughness and reliability?\nResearch methodology\n: This study uses a comparative methodology. The two inspection methods\u2014guideline reviews and heuristic evaluation\u2014are compared in a domain- and the culture-specific context in terms of the nature, time required, approach, templates, and results.\nResults:\nThe results reflect that both methods identify similar usability issues; however, they differ in terms of the nature, time duration, evaluation procedure, templates, and results of the evaluation.\nConclusion:\nThis study contributes by providing insights for practitioners and researchers about the choice of an evaluation method for domain- and culture-specific evaluation of university websites.\n\n[View](publication/364188542_Heuristic_Evaluation_Versus_Guideline_Reviews_A_Tale_of_Comparing_Two_Domain_Usability_Expert's_Evaluation_Methods)\n\nShow abstract\n\nShow more\n\n[How to Make a Decision: The Analytic Hierarchy Process](publication/307800676_How_to_Make_a_Decision_The_Analytic_Hierarchy_Process)\n\nArticle\n\nFull-text available\n\n- Mar 1994\n\n- [T.L.

This paper investigates the usability of higher education websites in Asia. First, an online Google application survey form was designed using Google Forms and used for the evaluation of web usability and student response. After a thorough analysis, a concise model was designed to evaluate the usability of educational websites called \"Web Usability Evaluation Model\" (WUEM). We evaluated ten top-ranked engineering universities in Asia against the features listed in the WUEM. The evaluation analysis shows that the academic websites are partly usable in their informational structure, navigation and also weak inaccessibility. The evaluation shows a detailed structural description of what needs to be improved in these websites to enhance their usability. The proposed WUEM helps in an effective and easy evaluation of websites by the web developers. The research will help academic web developers to enhance the usability of their websites by considering such simple features listed in WUEM.\n\n[View](publication/285758853_A_Web_Usability_Evaluation_Model_for_Higher_Education_Providing_Universities_of_Asia)\n\nShow abstract\n\n[Evaluating the Usability of Educational Websites Based on Students' Preferences of Design Characteristics](publication/281904323_Evaluating_the_Usability_of_Educational_Websites_Based_on_Students'_Preferences_of_Design_Characteristics)\n\nArticle\n\nFull-text available\n\n- Jan 2014\n\n- [![Layla Hasan](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAADUlEQVR42mN89OjNfwAJDwOxHEacwgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)Layla Hasan](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Layla-Hasan)\n\nThis research investigated the relative importance of specific design criteria developed for the purpose of this\nresearch, in the evaluation of the usability of educational websites from the point view of students; it then evaluated the usability of nine educational websites based on students\u2019 preferences. The results showed that content and navigation were the first and second preferred design categories to be considered while evaluating the usability of educational websites, while the\norganisation/architecture was the least important category. Also, the results showed that there was a statistically significant difference between males and females regarding only one category: the content. Females considered this to be the most important category while males considered it as the second most important. By contrast, the results showed that there were no statistically significant differences between the students of the two selected faculties (the Faculty of Information Technology and Science, and the Faculty of Economics and Administrative Sciences) concerning the relative importance of the developed criteria based on their majors/specialisations. In general, the results showed that the majority of the students were satisfied with the usability of the Jordanian university websites. Specifically, the results showed the students were satisfied with the content and navigation (ease of use) of the tested websites, but dissatisfied with the design of the websites.\n\n[View](publication/281904323_Evaluating_the_Usability_of_Educational_Websites_Based_on_Students'_Preferences_of_Design_Characteristics)\n\nShow abstract\n\n[Assessing a firm's Web presence: A heuristic evaluation procedure for the measurement of usability](publication/280697132_Assessing_a_firm's_Web_presence_A_heuristic_evaluation_procedure_for_the_measurement_of_usability)\n\nArticle\n\nFull-text available\n\n- Jun 2002\n\n- [R.

A measure of usability must not only provide a global rating for a specific Web site, ideally it should also illuminate specific strengths and weaknesses associated with site design. In this paper, we describe a heuristic evaluation procedure for examining the usability of Web sites. The procedure utilizes a comprehensive set of usability guidelines developed by Microsoft. We present the categories and subcategories comprising these guidelines, and discuss the development of an instrument that operationalizes the measurement of usability. The proposed instrument was tested in a heuristic evaluation study where 1,475 users rated multiple Web sites from four different industry sectors: airlines, online bookstores, automobile manufacturers, and car rental agencies. To enhance the external validity of the study, users were asked to assume the role of a consumer or an investor when assessing usability. Empirical results suggest that the evaluation procedure, the instrument, as well as the usability metric exhibit good properties. Implications of the findings for researchers, for Web site designers, and for heuristic evaluation methods in usability testing are offered.\n\n[View](publication/280697132_Assessing_a_firm's_Web_presence_A_heuristic_evaluation_procedure_for_the_measurement_of_usability)\n\nShow abstract\n\n[ANFIS Method for Usability Assessment of Website of an Educational Institute](publication/271831889_ANFIS_Method_for_Usability_Assessment_of_Website_of_an_Educational_Institute)\n\nArticle\n\nFull-text available\n\n- Jan 2013\n\n- [![Renuka Nagpal](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAADUlEQVR42mN89OjNfwAJDwOxHEacwgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)Renuka Nagpal](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Renuka-Nagpal)\n- [![Deepti Mehrotra](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAADUlEQVR42mN89OjNfwAJDwOxHEacwgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)Deepti Mehrotra](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Deepti-Mehrotra)\n- [![Arun Sharma](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAADUlEQVR42mN89OjNfwAJDwOxHEacwgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)Arun Sharma](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Arun-Sharma-38)\n- [![Pradeep Kumar Bhatia](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAADUlEQVR42mN89OjNfwAJDwOxHEacwgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)Pradeep Kumar Bhatia](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Pradeep-Bhatia-2)\n\nToday website is considered as an image of an organization. The advent of privatization has lead to a cut throat competition among the various educational institutes thus designing an effective website is very important. For designing an effective website it is required to identify the need of the visitors of the website. In current scenario the objective of websites of an educational institute is to provide the student and other users an information platform where they can retrieve any information and also can perform other tasks like learning and tracking records. In order to increase the usability of a website it is required to identify the important parameters that visitor look in a site. In this paper we have identified the important parameters that affect the usability of an educational websites and then propose a model for usability assessment using the Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System Approach (ANFIS).\n\n[View](publication/271831889_ANFIS_Method_for_Usability_Assessment_of_Website_of_an_Educational_Institute)\n\nShow abstract\n\n[Introduction to Multi-Criteria Decision Making and the Evidential Reasoning Approach](publication/308525634_Introduction_to_Multi-Criteria_Decision_Making_and_the_Evidential_Reasoning_Approach)\n\nArticle\n\n- Jan 2001\n\n- [L.

Many of these applications must be used by either employees of the organization or by e-customers of the organization. One of the key components of any web-based application is its interface, and a key criteria in utilization of these web-based applications is the website's usability. This study investigated five criteria that have been suggested to impact an individual's assessment of a website's usability. Utilizing a multi-criteria decision making approach, we were able to assess the relative importance of these criteria as they apply to website usability. Our findings suggest that, similar to the technology adoption literature, ease of use and navigation are two critical components in determining website usability. This study also investigated the impact of specific individual differences (gender, computer anxiety, innovativeness, and computer self-efficacy).\n\n[View](publication/285936594_An_exploratory_study_into_determining_the_relative_importance_of_key_criteria_in_Web_usability_A_multi-criteria_approach)\n\nShow abstract\n\n[Usability 101: introduction to usability](publication/285838148_Usability_101_introduction_to_usability)\n\nArticle\n\n- Jan 2003\n\n- [J.

It emphasizes that a website serves as an organizational image and a platform for information dissemination, offering functionalities such as academic monitoring and learning resources. The authors identified key usability parameters deemed important by website visitors, namely Ease of Use (EOU), Informative content (INF), Response Time (RT), and Ease of Navigation (EON).\n\nTo assess these parameters, a model based on Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) was proposed. This model integrates fuzzy logic with neural networks to provide a rigorous usability evaluation framework. The study undertakes a practical computational approach using MATLAB's fuzzy logic toolbox and demonstrates that the ANFIS model significantly enhances usability prediction accuracy from an initial error of 27% to a mere 3% after training, ultimately achieving a 97% usability assessment reliability.\n\nThe research entails an empirical survey involving current students and educational stakeholders to ascertain the parameters influencing website usability. The paper concludes by providing insights for web designers on enhancing user satisfaction and suggests that similar methodologies can be applied for analytics across various web domains. The findings underscore the critical nature of understanding user needs to design websites that are not only functional but also engaging for visitors.",

The advent of privatization has lead to a cut throat competition among the various educational institutes thus designing an effective website is very important. For designing an effective website it is required to identify the need of the visitors of the website. In current scenario the objective of websites of an educational institute is to provide the student and other users an information platform where they can retrieve any information and also can perform other tasks like learning and tracking records. In order to increase the usability of a website it is required to identify the important parameters that visitor look in a site. In this paper we have identified the important parameters that affect the usability of an educational websites and then propose a model for usability assessment using the Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System Approach (ANFIS).\n\n[![Training error(27%) mapping original FIS to ANFIS](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/27%)](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Training-error27-mapping-original-FIS-to-ANFIS_fig1_271831889 \"Fig. 4: Training error(27%) mapping original FIS to ANFIS \u00a0\")\n\n[Training error(27%) mapping original FIS to ANFIS\\\\\n\\\\\n\u2026](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Training-error27-mapping-original-FIS-to-ANFIS_fig1_271831889)\n\n[![Training error(3%) mapping new FIS to ANFIS](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/3%)](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Training-error3-mapping-new-FIS-to-ANFIS_fig2_271831889 \"Fig. 6: Training error(3%) mapping new FIS to ANFIS \u00a0\")\n\n[Training error(3%) mapping new FIS to ANFIS\\\\\n\\\\\n\u2026](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Training-error3-mapping-new-FIS-to-ANFIS_fig2_271831889)\n\n[![Testing error(3%) mapping new FIS to ANFIS RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS In this paper an ANFIS model is used for estimating Figure 4 and 5 shows training and testing data in Informative, Response Time and Ease of navigation.

Therefore it is essential to assess the impact on the sustainability of any aspect of its application. A conscious and responsible use of resources is needed. One feature that is associated with the term sustainable software is the usability. It is very usual to define usability as a software ease of use, but this definition is ambiguous. For this reason, there are several definitions according to different approaches to measure it. In the last decades, a lot of papers have been published about software usability assessment models. These models have evolved from the use of algorithms, conventional statistics techniques, and Soft Computing methods. The goal of this work is to offer a collection of annotated bibliography about the characteristics, attributes and metrics used in usability assessment, focused in the Soft Computing techniques.\n\n[View](publication/320772114_Fuzzy_Multi-criteria_Decision_Making_Methods_Applied_to_Usability_Software_Assessment_An_Annotated_Bibliography)\n\nShow abstract\n\n...

Contemporarily, the users (i.e., students/teachers, parents, and administrative staff) greatly rely on these websites to perform various academic tasks, including admission, access to learning management systems (LMS), and links to other relevant resources. These users vary from each other in terms of their technological competence, objectives, and frequency of use. Therefore, academic websites should be designed considering different dimensions, so that everybody can be accommodated. Knowing the different dimensions with respect to the usability of academic websites is a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem. The fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) approach has been considered to be a significant method to deal with the uncertainty that is involved in subjective judgment. Although a wide range of usability factors for academic websites have already been identified, most of them are based on the judgment of experts who have never used these websites. This study identified important factors through a detailed literature review, classified them, and prioritized the most critical among them through the FAHP methodology, involving relevant users to propose a usability evaluation framework for academic websites. To validate the proposed framework, five websites of renowned higher educational institutes (HEIs) were evaluated and ranked according to the usability criteria. As the proposed framework was created methodically, the authors believe that it would be helpful for detecting real usability issues that currently exist in academic websites.\n\n[View](publication/349303872_Evaluating_Usability_of_Academic_Websites_through_a_Fuzzy_Analytical_Hierarchical_Process)\n\nShow abstract\n\n...

Proposed model is the fusion of these two computing paradigms to create a successful synergic effect. The website usability dataset is derived from doctoral thesis on Usability Evaluation of Library Websites \\[1\\]. Usability index (UI) determinants such as visibility, SR\\_world, user control, consistency, error, recognition, flexibility, aesthetic, recovery, documentation, effectiveness, efficiency, memorability, learnability, satisfaction and motivation are considered here for computing. The reported investigations depicts optimum ANN architecture achieved by tuning the parameters viz. network type, training function, transfer function and number of neurons in hidden neurons. ANN architecture, thus derived entails hidden layer with nonlinear sigmoid activation function and Levenberg-Marquardt back propagation method for training the model. Moreover the performance of the model is evaluated with reference to Pearson Correlation Coefficient (r), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Gradient (g). Validation of the model has portrayed reasonably good prediction accuracy.\n\n[View](publication/332242357_Predicting_Usability_of_Library_Websites_Artificial_Neural_Network_and_Fuzzy_Inference_System_Approach)\n\nShow abstract\n\n[A systematic literature review on multi-criteria decision making in higher educationA systematic literature review on multi-criteria decision making in higher education](publication/369257738_A_systematic_literature_review_on_multi-criteria_decision_making_in_higher_educationA_systematic_literature_review_on_multi-criteria_decision_making_in_higher_education)\n\nArticle\n\n- Mar 2023\n\n- [![Fatma \u015eeyma Y\u00fcksel](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAADUlEQVR42mN89OjNfwAJDwOxHEacwgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)Fatma \u015eeyma Y\u00fcksel](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Fatma-Seyma-Yueksel)\n- [Ay\u015fe Nilg\u00fcn KAYADELEN](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Ayse-Nilguen-KAYADELEN-2209927671)\n- [![Z.Figen Antmen](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAADUlEQVR42mN89OjNfwAJDwOxHEacwgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)Z.Figen Antmen](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Zfigen-Antmen)\n\nThe three components that form the basis of the educational process are the teacher, the learner, and the environment. These three components are affected by the developing and changing technology as a result of globalization considerably. Teaching and learning techniques should be updated and connected with these developments; new tools are therefore needed to make the necessary updates. Determination and application of the new tools include many decisions. Decision-makers can make more effective decisions using Multi-Criteria Decision-Making Techniques (MCDM), a complex decision-making tool that includes both quantitative and qualitative factors at present time. This study aimed to determine which MCDM methods are used in studies conducted in higher education, which is one of the most important development level indicators of countries, and to present a systematic literature review of MCDM method applications. The study was conducted in three stages: first, known electronics were searched until the end of 2021 using keywords; then, all studies were listed in a systematic taxonomy, and in the last stage, Thematic Network Analysis was used to evaluate the development of MCDM studies in the higher education area. It is determined that the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) method is the most widely used method in higher education in MCDM applications. It was observed that the most common use of MCDM applications in higher education is e-learning as well. This study aims to be a guide for all researchers and practitioners who will study in both higher education and the MCDM areas.\n\n[View](publication/369257738_A_systematic_literature_review_on_multi-criteria_decision_making_in_higher_educationA_systematic_literature_review_on_multi-criteria_decision_making_in_higher_education)\n\nShow abstract\n\n[Modeling the Usability of University Websites as a Tool for Their Online Competitiveness in the Context of COVID-19](publication/363388459_Modeling_the_Usability_of_University_Websites_as_a_Tool_for_Their_Online_Competitiveness_in_the_Context_of_COVID-19)\n\nConference Paper\n\nFull-text available\n\n- Jan 2022\n\n- [![Kucherova Hanna](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAADUlEQVR42mN89OjNfwAJDwOxHEacwgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)Kucherova Hanna](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kucherova-Hanna-2)\n- [Abdukhakim Mamanazarov](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Abdukhakim-Mamanazarov-2122483237)\n- [Yuliia Honcharenko](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Yuliia-Honcharenko-2173170174)\n- [![Dmytro Ocheretin](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAADUlEQVR42mN89OjNfwAJDwOxHEacwgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)Dmytro Ocheretin](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Dmytro-Ocheretin)\n\n[View](publication/363388459_Modeling_the_Usability_of_University_Websites_as_a_Tool_for_Their_Online_Competitiveness_in_the_Context_of_COVID-19)\n\n[A Model for Ranking the Usability Attributes of Mobile Health Applications in Nigeria (MCDM Approach)](publication/350486986_A_Model_for_Ranking_the_Usability_Attributes_of_Mobile_Health_Applications_in_Nigeria_MCDM_Approach)\n\nArticle\n\nFull-text available\n\n- Dec 2020\n\n- [![Funmilayo Kasali](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAADUlEQVR42mN89OjNfwAJDwOxHEacwgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)Funmilayo Kasali](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Funmilayo-Kasali)\n- [Olubukola D Adekola](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Olubukola-D-Adekola-2207372824)\n- [![Ibidapo Olawole Akinyemi](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAADUlEQVR42mN89OjNfwAJDwOxHEacwgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)Ibidapo Olawole Akinyemi](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ibidapo-Akinyemi-2)\n- [![Jeremiah Ademola Balogun](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAADUlEQVR42mN89OjNfwAJDwOxHEacwgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)Jeremiah Ademola Balogun](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jeremiah-Balogun)\n\nIn Nigeria, the mobile health trend is gradually improving and generally upgrading the way healthcare services are being rendered. Assessing the usability of these apps is still a major task as a result of the many attributes embedded in most usability models. In other to rank some of these attributes, a Multi-Criteria Decision Making technique (MCDM) was used. The attributes ranked were adopted from the Enhanced Usability Model (EUM) which was designed based on the People at the Center of Mobile Application Development (PACMAD) model and the Integrated Measurement Model (IMM). Attributes were ranked using their priority weights based on the Triangular Fuzzy Numbers (TFN) and Fuzzy Chang extent analysis model. Results of evaluation showed that effectiveness and efficiency had the highest priorities with 40% and 33% while satisfaction, user interface aesthetics and universality had the lowest ranks. Three mHealth apps were analyzed and results showed that Omomi had the highest ranking with a weight of 41%, Find-A-Med ranked second with a weight of 30% while Hudibia ranked lowest with a weight of 29%. In conclusion, it was established that the mathematical technique used is a powerful tool for analyzing human decision-making process. Future works would consider other MCDM models and comparisons done.\n\n[View](publication/350486986_A_Model_for_Ranking_the_Usability_Attributes_of_Mobile_Health_Applications_in_Nigeria_MCDM_Approach)\n\nShow abstract\n\n[Towards an Intelligent Learning Management System: The A/B/C-TEACH Approach](publication/333423702_Towards_an_Intelligent_Learning_Management_System_The_ABC-TEACH_Approach)\n\nChapter\n\n- May 2019\n\n- [![Sofia Balula Dias](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAADUlEQVR42mN89OjNfwAJDwOxHEacwgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)Sofia Balula Dias](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sofia-Dias-8)\n- [![Sofia Hadjileontiadou](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAADUlEQVR42mN89OjNfwAJDwOxHEacwgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)Sofia Hadjileontiadou](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sofia-Hadjileontiadou)\n- [![Jos\u00e9 A Diniz](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAADUlEQVR42mN89OjNfwAJDwOxHEacwgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)Jos\u00e9 A Diniz](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jose-Diniz)\n- [![Leontios Hadjileontiadis](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAADUlEQVR42mN89OjNfwAJDwOxHEacwgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)Leontios Hadjileontiadis](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Leontios-Hadjileontiadis-2)\n\nThe new dimensions of e-community and e-identity have justified the integration of innovative methodologies in the design, implementation and development of the teaching-learning process at Higher Education Institutions (HEIs). The growing adoption of Learning Management Systems (LMSs) has led to the introduction of creative teaching/learning approaches and to the promotion of different educational contexts within the online environment. From this perspective, the A/B/C-TEACH project (http://abcteach.fmh.ulisboa.pt/) is presented here, exploring the ways effective teaching could be accomplished when bridging the fields of affective (a)-, blended (b)- and collaborative (c)-learning into a hybrid, LMS-based, enhanced teaching-learning environment.

In view of this, several efforts have been made to develop usability evaluation methods for different genre of websites. Due to its uniqueness, university websites which is a class of academic websites requires further attention. This paper hence provides a brief survey of various usability evaluation methods used in university websites and with special focus on multi criteria decision making (MCDM) approaches. A total of thirty five scholarly articles were retrieved from online database from year 2000 to 2018. The review was classified based on usability evaluation methods, MCDM approaches and automated tools. Results from the trend analysis shows that automated tools, heuristic evaluation and user testing methods are mostly used usability evaluation methods. MCDM approach usage in usability evaluation is also found to be on the increase as well. It is therefore recommended that more attention should be given to the usage of this methodology in the usability evaluation of this important genre of websites.\n\n[View](publication/327843861_A_Survey_of_Research_Trends_on_University_Websites'_Usability_Evaluation)\n\nShow abstract\n\n[Designing ANFIS Model to Predict the Reliability of Component-Based System](publication/321294518_Designing_ANFIS_Model_to_Predict_the_Reliability_of_Component-Based_System)\n\nChapter\n\n- Jan 2018\n\n- [Rajni Sehgal](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Rajni-Sehgal-2065802010)\n- [![Deepti Mehrotra](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAADUlEQVR42mN89OjNfwAJDwOxHEacwgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)Deepti Mehrotra](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Deepti-Mehrotra)\n- [![Manju Bala](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAADUlEQVR42mN89OjNfwAJDwOxHEacwgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)Manju Bala](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Manju-Bala-17)\n\n[View](publication/321294518_Designing_ANFIS_Model_to_Predict_the_Reliability_of_Component-Based_System)\n\nShow more\n\n[A Web Usability Evaluation Model for Higher Education Providing Universities of Asia](publication/285758853_A_Web_Usability_Evaluation_Model_for_Higher_Education_Providing_Universities_of_Asia)\n\nArticle\n\nFull-text available\n\n- Jan 2012\n\n- [![Mirfa Manzoor](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAADUlEQVR42mN89OjNfwAJDwOxHEacwgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)Mirfa Manzoor](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mirfa-Manzoor)\n- [![Walayat Hussain](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAADUlEQVR42mN89OjNfwAJDwOxHEacwgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)Walayat Hussain](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Walayat-Hussain)\n\nThis study is a reflection on a usability evaluation of educational websites for the subject of modelling web usability guidelines for educational websites. This paper investigates the usability of higher education websites in Asia. First, an online Google application survey form was designed using Google Forms and used for the evaluation of web usability and student response. After a thorough analysis, a concise model was designed to evaluate the usability of educational websites called \"Web Usability Evaluation Model\" (WUEM). We evaluated ten top-ranked engineering universities in Asia against the features listed in the WUEM. The evaluation analysis shows that the academic websites are partly usable in their informational structure, navigation and also weak inaccessibility. The evaluation shows a detailed structural description of what needs to be improved in these websites to enhance their usability. The proposed WUEM helps in an effective and easy evaluation of websites by the web developers. The research will help academic web developers to enhance the usability of their websites by considering such simple features listed in WUEM.\n\n[View](publication/285758853_A_Web_Usability_Evaluation_Model_for_Higher_Education_Providing_Universities_of_Asia)\n\nShow abstract\n\n[The Importance of Website Innovation on Students' Satisfaction of University Websites](publication/265425954_The_Importance_of_Website_Innovation_on_Students'_Satisfaction_of_University_Websites)\n\nArticle\n\nFull-text available\n\n- Jan 2012\n\n- [Ali Rezaeean](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Ali-Rezaeean-2053815943)\n- [Sona Bairamzadeh](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Sona-Bairamzadeh-74932649)\n- [![Alireza Bolhari](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAADUlEQVR42mN89OjNfwAJDwOxHEacwgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)Alireza Bolhari](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alireza-Bolhari)\n\nIn today's highly developed academic societies, universities have recognized the importance of having websites to be able to benefit from appropriate academic communications. In addition, students' satisfaction from a university website shows to some extent university's web success. The purpose of this study is to investigate the importance of university's website innovation and to propose a satisfaction model. The survey was conducted among 270 university students. Results of the empirical analysis revealed that greater innovation has a significant impact on users' trust and satisfaction. More than that, innovation is the most important factor influencing the satisfaction. Also students' trust increases as they perceive the system is usable. Finally, trust has a positive influence on satisfaction.\n\n[View](publication/265425954_The_Importance_of_Website_Innovation_on_Students'_Satisfaction_of_University_Websites)\n\nShow abstract\n\n[A Usability Evaluation Model for Academic Library Websites: Efficiency, Effectiveness and Learnability](publication/265281974_A_Usability_Evaluation_Model_for_Academic_Library_Websites_Efficiency_Effectiveness_and_Learnability)\n\nArticle\n\nFull-text available\n\n- Dec 2011\n\n- [Soohyung Joo](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Soohyung-Joo-70871413)\n- [Suyu Lin](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Suyu-Lin-2053534581)\n- [![Kun Lu](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAADUlEQVR42mN89OjNfwAJDwOxHEacwgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)Kun Lu](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kun-Lu-2)\n\nPurpose \u2013 This paper aimed to develop a usability evaluation model and associated survey tool in the context of academic libraries. This study not only proposed a usability evaluation model but also a practical survey tool tailored to academic library websites. Design/methodology \u2013 A usability evaluation model has been developed for academic library websites based on literature review and expert consultation. Then, the authors verified the reliability and validity of the usability evaluation model empirically using the survey data from actual users. Statistical analysis, such as descriptive statistics, internal consistency test, and a factor analysis, were applied to ensure both the reliability and validity of the usability evaluation tool. Findings \u2013 From the document analysis and expert consultation, this study identified eighteen measurement items to survey the three constructs of the usability, effectiveness, efficiency, and learnability, in academic library websites. The evaluation tool was then validated with regard to data distribution, reliability, and validity. The empirical examination based on 147 actual user responses proved the survey evaluation tool suggested herein is acceptable in assessing academic library website usability. Originality/Value \u2013 This research is one of the few studies to engender a practical survey tool in evaluating library website usability. The usability model and corresponding survey tool would be useful for librarians and library administrators in academic libraries who plan to conduct a usability evaluation involving large sample.\n\n[View](publication/265281974_A_Usability_Evaluation_Model_for_Academic_Library_Websites_Efficiency_Effectiveness_and_Learnability)\n\nShow abstract\n\n[A Neuro Fuzzy Computing Technique for Modeling Hydrological Time Series](publication/256426451_A_Neuro_Fuzzy_Computing_Technique_for_Modeling_Hydrological_Time_Series)\n\nArticle\n\nFull-text available\n\n- May 2004\n- J HYDROL\n\n- [![P.

Recently there has been a growing interest in combining both these approaches, and as a result, neuro-fuzzy computing techniques have evolved. This approach has been tested and evaluated in the field of signal processing and related areas, but researchers have only begun evaluating the potential of this neuro-fuzzy hybrid approach in hydrologic modeling studies. This paper presents the application of an adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) to hydrologic time series modeling, and is illustrated by an application to model the river flow of Baitarani River in Orissa state, India. An introduction to the ANFIS modeling approach is also presented. The advantage of the method is that it does not require the model structure to be known a priori, in contrast to most of the time series modeling techniques. The results showed that the ANFIS forecasted flow series preserves the statistical properties of the original flow series. The model showed good performance in terms of various statistical indices. The results are highly promising, and a comparative analysis suggests that the proposed modeling approach outperforms ANNs and other traditional time series models in terms of computational speed, forecast errors, efficiency, peak flow estimation etc. It was observed that the ANFIS model preserves the potential of the ANN approach fully, and eases the model building process.\n\n[View](publication/256426451_A_Neuro_Fuzzy_Computing_Technique_for_Modeling_Hydrological_Time_Series)\n\nShow abstract\n\n[Designing the user interface: strategies for effective human-computer interaction](publication/319394404_Designing_the_user_interface_strategies_for_effective_human-computer_interaction)\n\nBook\n\n- Jan 2010\n\n- [![Ben Shneiderman](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAADUlEQVR42mN89OjNfwAJDwOxHEacwgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)Ben Shneiderman](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ben-Shneiderman)\n- [Catherine Plaisant](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Catherine-Plaisant-2132312801)\n\n[View](publication/319394404_Designing_the_user_interface_strategies_for_effective_human-computer_interaction)\n\n[An exploratory study into determining the relative importance of key criteria in Web usability: A multi-criteria approach](publication/285936594_An_exploratory_study_into_determining_the_relative_importance_of_key_criteria_in_Web_usability_A_multi-criteria_approach)\n\nArticle\n\n- Jun 2008\n\n- [![J.

Many of these applications must be used by either employees of the organization or by e-customers of the organization. One of the key components of any web-based application is its interface, and a key criteria in utilization of these web-based applications is the website's usability. This study investigated five criteria that have been suggested to impact an individual's assessment of a website's usability. Utilizing a multi-criteria decision making approach, we were able to assess the relative importance of these criteria as they apply to website usability. Our findings suggest that, similar to the technology adoption literature, ease of use and navigation are two critical components in determining website usability. This study also investigated the impact of specific individual differences (gender, computer anxiety, innovativeness, and computer self-efficacy).\n\n[View](publication/285936594_An_exploratory_study_into_determining_the_relative_importance_of_key_criteria_in_Web_usability_A_multi-criteria_approach)\n\nShow abstract\n\n[Assessing and Prioritizing Affecting Factors in E-Learning Websites Using AHP Method and Fuzzy Approach](publication/266176173_Assessing_and_Prioritizing_Affecting_Factors_in_E-Learning_Websites_Using_AHP_Method_and_Fuzzy_Approach)\n\nArticle\n\n- Jan 2012\n\n- [Mehrbakhsh Nilashi](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Mehrbakhsh-Nilashi-2042463382)\n- [Nasim Janahmadi](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Nasim-Janahmadi-2053149543)\n\nThe evolution of information technologies has caused to the growth in online training as an important education method.

In particular, it focused on nine Jordanian university websites. Evaluation criteria for assessing the usability of educational websites were developed; these consisted of five categories: navigation, architecture / organisation, ease of use and communication, design and content. Then 237 students were asked to provide ratings for nine Jordanian university websites using the developed usability criteria and their categories. Students were also asked to report qualitatively what they liked and disliked regarding the design of the tested websites. The results provided detailed information for each tested website regarding their conformance with the developed usability criteria. The results showed that the majority of the students were satisfied with the usability of the Jordanian university websites. Specifically, the results showed that the students were satisfied with the content and navigation (ease of use) issues of the tested websites, but were dissatisfied with the design of the websites. Common and unique strengths and weaknesses related to design issues of the investigated websites were identified based on the quantitative results and the qualitative data obtained from the open-ended questions.\n\n[View](publication/261468700_Evaluating_the_usability_of_nine_Jordanian_university_websites)\n\nShow abstract\n\n[Designing the User Interface: Strategies for Effective Human - Computer Interaction: Fourth Edition](publication/248594286_Designing_the_User_Interface_Strategies_for_Effective_Human_-_Computer_Interaction_Fourth_Edition)\n\nArticle\n\n- Jan 1987\n\n- [![Ben Shneiderman](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAADUlEQVR42mN89OjNfwAJDwOxHEacwgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)Ben Shneiderman](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ben-Shneiderman)\n- [![Catherine Plaisant](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAADUlEQVR42mN89OjNfwAJDwOxHEacwgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)Catherine Plaisant](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Catherine-Plaisant)\n\n[View](publication/248594286_Designing_the_User_Interface_Strategies_for_Effective_Human_-_Computer_Interaction_Fourth_Edition)\n\n[Usability engineering at a discount](publication/242375192_Usability_engineering_at_a_discount)\n\nArticle\n\n- Sep 1989\n\n- [J.

The chances of being misinformed increase multifold as our reliance on sources of information are getting ambiguous. Traditional news sources followed strict codes of practice to verify stories, whereas today, users can upload news items on social media and unverified portals without proving their veracity. The absence of any determinants of such news articles\u2019 truthfulness on the Internet calls for a novel approach to determine the realness quotient of unverified news items by leveraging technology. This study presents a dynamic model with a secure voting system, where news reviewers can provide feedback on news, and a probabilistic mathematical model is used for predicting the truthfulness of the news item based on the feedback received. A blockchain-based model, ProBlock is proposed; so that correctness of information propagated is ensured.\n\n### Similar content being viewed by others\n\n![](https://media.springernature.com/w92h120/springer-static/cover-hires/book/978-3-031-20160-8?as=webp)\n\n### [The Role of Blockchain to Reduce the Dissemination of Fake News on Social Media and Messaging Platforms](https://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-031-20160-8_15?fromPaywallRec=false)\n\nChapter\u00a9 2023\n\n![](https://media.springernature.com/w92h120/springer-static/cover-hires/book/978-981-99-8211-0?as=webp)\n\n### [A Blockchain System for Fake News Detection](https://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-981-99-8211-0_1?fromPaywallRec=false)\n\nChapter\u00a9 2024\n\n![](https://media.springernature.com/w215h120/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10586-024-04637-7/MediaObjects/10586_2024_4637_Fig1_HTML.png)\n\n### [Connecting the dots between stance and fake news detection with blockchain, proof of reputation, and the Hoeffding bound](https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10586-024-04637-7?fromPaywallRec=false)\n\nArticle27 June 2024\n\n### Explore related subjects\n\nDiscover the latest articles, news and stories from top researchers in related subjects.\n\n- [Artificial Intelligence](/subject/artificial-intelligence)\n\n[Use our pre-submission checklist](https://beta.springernature.com/pre-submission?journalId=10586)\n\nAvoid common mistakes on your manuscript.\n\n## 1 Introduction\n\nIn recent years, fake news and rumours have been a cause of significant societal losses. Misinformation, in the form of doctored articles, memes, and unverified posts from anonymous users has triggered multiple incidents in the real world that have caused the loss of life and reputation worldwide. The year 2019 was termed the \u201cYear of Fake News\u201d by The Economic Times.[Footnote 1](#Fn1) The distribution of misinformation on sensitive socio-political issues has caused widespread outrage among citizens, even leading to riots. India, which leads the world social media user charts, is at a greater risk of being affected by the spread of such fake news, hate propaganda, and rumours. Major factors for the spreading of fake news include social factors, cognitive factors, political factors, financial factors, and malicious factors \\[ [1](/article/10.1007/s10586-021-03361-w#ref-CR1 \"Celliers, M., Hattingh, M.: A systematic review on fake news themes reported in literature.

In 2016, a series of false tweets by Netizens about a pizza joint being part of a pedophile sex ring involving former U.S.A. secretary of state Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and her campaign members triggered a shooting incident in Washington, D.C., U.S.A.[Footnote 2](#Fn2) The primary reasons for the prevalence of fake news have been revenue generation \\[ [1](/article/10.1007/s10586-021-03361-w#ref-CR1 \"Celliers, M., Hattingh, M.: A systematic review on fake news themes reported in literature.

As fake news cases rise, solutions must be deployed to identify and stop the spread of this misinformation online.\n\nExpert knowledge and machine learning algorithms are two common approaches used to identify the fictitious articles deliberately fabricated to deceive readers \\[ [4](/article/10.1007/s10586-021-03361-w#ref-CR4 \"Bondielli, A., Marcelloni, F.: A survey on fake news and rumour detection techniques.

Int. Res. J. Eng. Technol. (IRJET) 6(01), 308\u2013309 (2019)\")\\]. Fake news and hoaxes are created in all media types, including text, image, audio, or video clips. Researchers have developed efficient computational algorithms for one type of news article, but if one wants to develop a real-time system that can handle all types of fake news, the system itself will be very complex \\[ [6](/article/10.1007/s10586-021-03361-w#ref-CR6 \"Shrivastava, G., Kumar, P., Ojha, R.P., Srivastava, P.K., Mohan, S., Srivastava, G.: Defensive modeling of fake news through online social networks. IEEE Trans. Comput. Soc. Syst. 7(5), 1159\u20131167 (2020)\")\\]. However, an expert-based system, though involving human input may have reduced complexity and increased efficiency. Furthermore, the date and context of news are equally essential for judging the worth of news pieces. It is often observed that an old news piece or some clipping of an old event or movie scene is recirculated as news. These issues themselves motivate us to look into expert-based detection methods. Our novel approach in this paper involves analyzing feedback given by one or more subject matter experts reviewing news items, one-by-one in a centralized manner, giving votes, labels, or scores to the news items and attempting to determine its degree of truthfulness \\[ [7](/article/10.1007/s10586-021-03361-w#ref-CR7 \"Zhou, X., Zafarani, R., Shu, K., Liu, H.: Fake news: Fundamental theories, detection strategies and challenges. In: Proceedings of the twelfth ACM international conference on web search and data mining, pp. 836\u2013837 (2019)\")\\]. The expert may differ in opinion, so while evaluating the score of trust for given news, the expert\u2019s votes should be weighted as per their expertise. It has encouraged us to explore a probabilistic model for calculating the score. Although all mentioned techniques show promising results and have been used widely, a centralized voting technique allows experts to give the score one after the other, thus lengthening the review process. Also, there is a threat to the security of new pieces and their corresponding votes caused due to the insecure method of their storage, making them easily editable with the integrity of votes being questionable in such a system. Therefore, to counter this known issue, in this paper we use blockchain technology to design the model.\n\nIn this paper, a framework called ProBlock is proposed and implemented as an efficient, secure, and reliable fake news detection technique. ProBlock uses blockchain technology to design a secured framework where the experts\u2019 votes are dynamically stored and shared. The blockchain is an immutable ledger to maintain all news pieces\u2019 entries and securely store their corresponding votes. The cryptographic encryption of blocks provides for a secure environment for storing the news pieces \\[ [8](/article/10.1007/s10586-021-03361-w#ref-CR8 \"Lange, M., Leiter, S.C., Alt, R.: Defining and delimitating distributed ledger technology: results of a structured literature analysis. In: Proceedings of the International Conference on Business Process Management, pp. 43\u201354. Springer (2019)\")\\]. The blockchain ensures that the news pieces and votes cannot be changed or modified at any point in time \\[ [9](/article/10.1007/s10586-021-03361-w#ref-CR9 \"Gaurav, A.B., Kumar, P., Kumar, V., Thakur, R.S.: Conceptual insights in blockchain technology: Security and applications. In: Proceedings of the Transforming Businesses With Bitcoin Mining and Blockchain Applications, pp. 221\u2013233. IGI Global (2020)\")\\]. A news piece, whose truthfulness is to be determined, is voted on by authorized reviewers giving scores based on its degree of genuineness and confidence about it. Next, the votes are weighted based on the credentials of the reviewer such as experience, designation, affiliations. As the reviewers come from diverse backgrounds and work experiences, some votes may be more trustworthy than others; hence a weighted system is vital and allows us to consider a more significant number of factors to evaluate them in a more trustworthy manner. Profiling of the experts helps to get a better understanding of their credibility. We introduce the ProBit model, a probabilistic mathematical model that analyzes the weighted votes to predict their accuracy. The ProBit model allows us to consider the reviewers\u2019 features and the votes to generate a final score for credible deception detection. As the truthfulness label of the variable newsPiece (dependent variable) in this case can only take two possible values (genuine or fake), the ProBit model is the most appropriate model of this analysis \\[ [10](/article/10.1007/s10586-021-03361-w#ref-CR10 \"Shao, X., Ma, X., Chen, F., Song, M., Pan, X., You, K.: A random parameters ordered probit analysis of injury severity in truck involved rear-end collisions.

The immutability of data stored on the blockchain is utilized to ensure no modification of the posted newsPieces and the simultaneous casting of votes by the reviewers in a distributed environment taking into account exogenous factors trust in the system.\n\n**Fig. 1**\n\n[![figure 1](https://link.springer.com/media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10586-021-03361-w/MediaObjects/10586_2021_3361_Fig1_HTML.png)](/article/10.1007/s10586-021-03361-w/figures/1)\n\nFramework for fake news detection\n\n[Full size image](/article/10.1007/s10586-021-03361-w/figures/1)\n\nThe proposed framework for ProBlock is given in Fig.\u00a0[1](/article/10.1007/s10586-021-03361-w#Fig1). The weighted majority voting model is implemented here by calculating a score based on the experts\u2019 interpretation of its fakeness. The weight of experts\u2019 votes is evaluated using a dynamic scoring approach where experts\u2019 career statistics and their confidence about their vote to the newsPiece is considered. An expScore is computed for each review cycle consisting of static and dynamic inputs for every expert. The static component of the expScore consists of a score based on the analysis of the reviewers\u2019 experience, organization of affiliation and designation. The dynamic score is computed based on the frequency of the reviewer and the accuracy of each review. The probability of the newsPiece being genuine is computed using the ProBit model where different experts\u2019 ratings and their expScore is considered as input. Based on the news rating, the false news is deleted from the blockchain; else continued in the blockchain, and finally, the upgraded rating of the experts is recalculated. The Proof of Trust consensus algorithm is used for the implementation of the model.\n\nIn this paper, a private blockchain has been leveraged to ensure the privacy of the reviewer votes at all times. ProBlock involves simplified data handling processes that are not accessible to every block. It offers a faster output with high power efficiency and at the same time ensures sufficient data privacy \\[ [11](/article/10.1007/s10586-021-03361-w#ref-CR11 \"Kwak, K.H., Kong, J.T., Cho, S.I., Phuong, H.T., Gim, G.Y.: A study on the design of efficient private blockchain.

The most vital need for the detection of fake content online is that it must be accurate, secure, and timely. Its accountability needs to be high on online social networks. Most of the methods used to address this issue consider it to be a classification problem giving fake or \u2018not fake\u2019 Boolean responses. Previously, Zhang et al. developed a credibility inference model for fake news detection by extracting explicit and latent features from the dataset building deep diffusive networks \\[ [16](/article/10.1007/s10586-021-03361-w#ref-CR16 \"Zhang, J., Dong, B., Philip, S.Y.: Fakedetector: Effective fake news detection with deep diffusive neural network.

Some adopted methodologies try to rate given news on a fakeness scale.

Manual fact-checking techniques involve the labelling or voting for the news pieces in hand by a small group of domain experts giving fairly accurate results. PolitiFact is an American political news verification portal that analyses textual data to give labels like True; Mostly true; Half true; Mostly false; False; Pants on fire.[Footnote 3](#Fn3) It follows a highly centralized architecture where domain specialists vote or one by one label the news items. Other platforms following a similar approach are The Washington Post Fact Checker,[Footnote 4](#Fn4) FactCheck,[Footnote 5](#Fn5) Snopes,[Footnote 6](#Fn6) where the process of verification relies on expert knowledge. All these techniques provide 3\u20135 predefined labels for selected domain news verification. Crowdsourced fact-checking has also been leveraged on a large scale through individual congregations or websites. A group of regular individuals act as fact-checkers and cast their votes for the news pieces. This technique is highly unreliable as fact-checkers\u2019 credibility is unverified. Their individual biases may lead to ambiguous results. Website-based crowdsourced news verification systems include the users uploading news articles and headlines with appropriate tags, and the sentences are rated to distinguish the content types (e.g., news versus non-news) and determine their veracity (true vs. not-true). The tags are included to study patterns as to where the probability of news being fake is highest.

However, the method\u2019s the model\u2019s computational complexity increases drastically by increasing the number of levels in it Existing automatic fact-checking methodologies rely on fact retrieval followed by natural language processing.

The analyzer compares the extracted facts from the article to a \u201cknowledge base\u201d to generate an authenticity index.\n\nThough these results display promising levels of accuracy, having a centralized approach makes them susceptible to modification and tampering. Blockchain technology enables a decentralized and distributed environment with no need for a central authority. Transactions are simultaneously secure and trustworthy because of the use of cryptographic principles. A distributed environment allows for immediate feedback from multiple networks which allows reviewers to participate simultaneously. ProBlock aims at implementing a secure voting and news storage environment for the detection of fake news via majority voting. Fake news on the internet is in the form of textual, image, and video-based forms. A machine-based approach would involve the development and implementation of a highly complex system that would be able to process all types of data efficiently. On the other hand, an expert-based system would be relatively less complex, be more efficient, and involve greater accuracy in real-time.\n\n## 3 Proposed methodology\n\nSection\u00a0[2](/article/10.1007/s10586-021-03361-w#Sec2) shows the need for a robust fact-checking mechanism that is secure and trustworthy. ProBlock aims to implement a secure voting and news storage environment for detecting fake news via a weighted majority voting.\n\n### 3.1 Majority voting\n\nA pure majority voting model is a decision that selects alternatives that have a majority, that is, more than half the votes. Each vote is equal and holds the same value. A majority voting model can be incorporated for the detection of fake news. A fake news identification majority voting model would include a panel of journalists, experts, and reviewers who would study and analyze news items before they are uploaded to the portal and give boolean decisions on their veracity. Every reviewer or expert can pass a vote on the truthfulness of the news after thorough verification of the news item. A pure majority voting model would ideally have only two votes, real or fake, and hence the outcome of the voting process would be deterministic, excluding the case of a draw. Each vote is assumed to be equal, free, and fair. However, the pure majority voting model is precarious. The factor that makes this pure majority voting model successful for detecting fake news is that the votes of all reviewers or experts may not be on the same level. In terms of trustworthiness and experience, some experts outweigh others. Biases may get incorporated into the system based on their organization of affiliation. Their judgment capabilities and accuracy of reviews may vary. Hence, every vote in a majority voting method cannot hold the same value. This paper presents a weighted majority voting system where selected parameters and factors would be determining the weight of each vote for the detection of fake news via blockchain. The weight of each vote will be computed based on a predetermined rule system.\n\nThe weighted majority voting model is incorporated into the blockchain via the Proof of Trust (PoT) consensus protocol \\[ [32](/article/10.1007/s10586-021-03361-w#ref-CR32 \"Bahri, L., Girdzijauskas, S.: When trust saves energy: a reference framework for proof of trust (pot) blockchains. In: Proceedings of the Companion Proceedings of the The Web Conference, 2018, pp. 1165\u20131169 (2018)\")\\]. In PoT, a digital token is sent to the network users, and a special class of users (experts in this case) are sent a \u201cpuzzle\u201d (generally a hash function or a simple integer factorization) which is to be solved, and its solutions are compared. The solution getting the highest number of responses is considered correct, and the block gets placed in the chain. In the given scenario, the \u201cpuzzle\u201d is the voting system where the experts give votes (which are weighted as per calculations) and are compared to find the most common solution or range of solutions. If for a certain block, the solution lies in the parts to the completely confident range, the block gets incorporated into the chain. The PoT protocol eliminates the low throughput and resource-intensive problems linked to Proof of Work (PoW), while at the same time addressing the scalability issues known to exist in traditional Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT)-based protocols.\n\n### 3.2 Voting system\n\nIn a voting system, multiple individuals come together to analyze the pros and cons of an object, thing, or situation by assigning labels or scores to it based on its characteristics. For ProBlock, a voting system is implemented by creating a class of users consisting of reviewers, subject experts, and journalists who are the voters of the majority voting system. Each newsPiece is reviewed and analyzed by this class of users, and each expert passes a semi-deterministic vote as a judgment on the veracity of the newsPiece. The weighted majority voting model is implemented here by calculating a score based on the experts\u2019 interpretation of its fakeness and his career statistics and a score based on their confidence about their vote to the newsPiece. An expScore is computed for each review cycle which is an integer score consisting of a static and dynamic basis for every expert. The static component of the expScore consists of a score based on the analysis of the reviewers\u2019 experience, organization, and designation as referred to in Table\u00a0[1](/article/10.1007/s10586-021-03361-w#Tab1). The relative score is given to each criterion and help create the expert\u2019s profile, which helps attach greater accountability and trust with the vote. The profiling of the expert helps to attach greater accountability and trust with the vote. The integer score is calculated from the stated factors and is combined with the dynamic component. The dynamic component of the expScore is re-calculated after each review.\n\n**Table 1 ExpScore calculation metrics**\n\n[Full size table](/article/10.1007/s10586-021-03361-w/tables/1)\n\nThe dynamic component of the expScore is re-calculated after each review cycle is over. It is based on the frequency of the reviewer and the accuracy of each review. The dynamic component is also an integer value. Both the static and dynamic components are added to form the expScore.\n\nBased on the number of correct predictions of reviews for the total number of reviews, the reviewer is given an accuracy score (accScore) which determines the success rate of the reviewer. It acts as a measure of dependability for the system. The consensus algorithm being used is a modified version of the standard PoT consensus protocol. The weighted voting and dynamic component further add multiple layers of trust towards the system by determining the credibility of the voter and his corresponding votes. These layers of trust also contribute towards more realistic scenarios of fake news detection as the voting process becomes much more credible. The expScore is calculated by calling the calExpScore() method as shown in Listing\u00a01.\n\n![figure e](https://link.springer.com/media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10586-021-03361-w/MediaObjects/10586_2021_3361_Fige_HTML.png)\n\nThe expScore is calculated by calling the calExpScore() method as shown in Listing 2.\n\n![figure f](https://link.springer.com/media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10586-021-03361-w/MediaObjects/10586_2021_3361_Figf_HTML.png)\n\nA confidenceScore indicates the surety of the vote cast by the reviewer in a range of \\\\(-\\\\,1\\\\) to \\\\(+\\\\,1\\\\). This confidenceScore is given by the reviewer itself and indicates his/her confidence in his vote. A scale is prepared where:\n\n- \\\\(\\\\blacksquare\\\\) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a01: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0**Not confident**\n\n- \\\\(\\\\blacksquare\\\\) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a02: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0**Confident**\n\n- \\\\(\\\\blacksquare\\\\) \u00a0\u00a0\u00a03: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0**Highly Confident**\n\n\nThe newsVote is given by the reviewer on a scale of \\\\(-\\\\,2\\\\) to \\\\(+\\\\,2\\\\) indicating the reviewer\u2019s analysis of whether the newsPiece is genuine where:\n\n- \\\\(\\\\blacksquare\\\\)\\\\(-\\\\,2\\\\): \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0**Completely False**\n\n- \\\\(\\\\blacksquare\\\\)\\\\(-\\\\,1\\\\): \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0**Partially False**\n\n- \\\\(\\\\blacksquare\\\\)\\\\(+\\\\,0\\\\): \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0**Neutral**\n\n- \\\\(\\\\blacksquare\\\\)\\\\(+\\\\,1\\\\): \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0**Partially True**\n\n- \\\\(\\\\blacksquare\\\\)\\\\(+\\\\,2\\\\): \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0**Completely True**\n\n\nThe confidenceScore is mathematically combined with the newsVote to calculate the cummVote i.e the cumulative vote.\n\nThe finalVote is then weighted with the expScore and hence the weighted majority voting model is implemented. The expScore is converted to a decimal value between 0 and 1 for the weighting purpose. The expScore is taken as the weight and the cummVote is taken as the vote in the weighted voting system.\n\n### 3.3 ProBit model\n\nA probabilistic analysis of the votes is made to determine the probability of the newsPiece taken into consideration being genuine or fake. The probability of the newsPiece falling into the score range of \u2018real\u2019 news is determined using the **ProBit** model \\[ [33](/article/10.1007/s10586-021-03361-w#ref-CR33 \"Egelhofer, J.L., Lecheler, S.: Fake news as a two-dimensional phenomenon: a framework and research agenda.

This encryption is done to ensure no tampering is done to the vote. A method is included which prompts a dialogue box on sensing any change in the hash of the votes.\n\nThe total number of reviews made by a reviewer is incremented every time a review is made by that particular reviewer. Furthermore, a monthly frequency is generated out of the reviews made by a reviewer in a particular month. The accuracy of the reviewer is further calculated for updating dynamic components of expScore and is expressed as the probability of a review of being correct based on the value stored in the correctness counter.\n\n#### 3.3.1 Numerical example\n\nAn experimental analysis of an online news portal, was created in a fashion so that the news outlet\u2019s goal would be to get all news items they have gathered to be verified before they are published on their platform. Table\u00a0[2](/article/10.1007/s10586-021-03361-w#Tab2) represents a mix of genuine and fake news headlines with their respective details that are used in our analysis. Each news item (row) has information about that speficic story and has an _Actual Veracity_ binary value of True or False (Fake). A total of 40 newsPieces are analyzed by 9 reviewers. The number of reviewers voting on the newsPiece keeps incrementally increasing in no particular order.\n\n**Table 2 NewsPiece(s) with category, newsCode and actual veracity**\n\n[Full size table](/article/10.1007/s10586-021-03361-w/tables/2)\n\nIn Table\u00a0[3](/article/10.1007/s10586-021-03361-w#Tab3), data of the reviewers is taken as input for the members of the reviewer class and the expScore is calculated. The factors on which expScore is evaluated for each reviewer are experience,organization they belong to, designation,number of reviews done per month. The factors on which expScore is evaluated for each reviewer are experience, the organization they belong to, designation, number of reviews done per month. Table\u00a0[1](/article/10.1007/s10586-021-03361-w#Tab1), Table\u00a0[3](/article/10.1007/s10586-021-03361-w#Tab3), Listing\u00a01, and Listing\u00a02 are used for calculating expscore.\n\nA probabilistic analysis of newsPiece being genuine is made using the ProBit model. By using the ProBit model. Simultaneously, a probability is also calculated by counting the number of positively, negatively, and neutrally weighted votes for comparison.\n\n**Table 3 Reviewer details with experience, designation. frequency**\n\n[Full size table](/article/10.1007/s10586-021-03361-w/tables/3)\n\n### 3.4 Calculations\n\nFrom the probabilistic analysis conducted in Table\u00a0[4](/article/10.1007/s10586-021-03361-w#Tab4) using the ProBit model, we can see the probabilities of news items being genuine. We also conclude that the probability calculation using the ProBit model is much more accurate in classifying the newsPieces as genuine or fake.\n\nFor the experimental data, the first newsPiece being considered for review is Tech101 which gets a confScore of 3, 2, and 2 and a newsVote of 1, 2, and 1 from the three reviewers, respectively. This leads to a combined score of 3, 2 and 2. The cumulative scores get weighted by multiplying each of them with the expScores giving the finalScores. Using Eqs.\u00a0[4](/article/10.1007/s10586-021-03361-w#Equ4) and [5](/article/10.1007/s10586-021-03361-w#Equ5), we get values of 23.33 and 9.84. Taking these values as input for Eq.\u00a0[6](/article/10.1007/s10586-021-03361-w#Equ6) we get 0.912 indicating a percentage probability of 91.2%. Table\u00a0[4](/article/10.1007/s10586-021-03361-w#Tab4) represents the results obtained by applying Eqs.\u00a0[1](/article/10.1007/s10586-021-03361-w#Equ1) to [6](/article/10.1007/s10586-021-03361-w#Equ6) on the votes of the reviewers. We see in Table\u00a0[4](/article/10.1007/s10586-021-03361-w#Tab4) that each newsPiece has specific metrics that we can calculate for it such as Standard Deviation, Probability of Fakeness, etc. These are all summarized in Table\u00a0[4](/article/10.1007/s10586-021-03361-w#Tab4).\n\n**Table 4 ProBit analysis of newsPieces**\n\n[Full size table](/article/10.1007/s10586-021-03361-w/tables/4)\n\nFigure\u00a0[2](/article/10.1007/s10586-021-03361-w#Fig2) shows the Gaussian distribution of the probabilities.

Each of these blocks of data (i.e. block) is secured and bound to each other using cryptographic principles (i.e. chain). Blockchain architecture of the proposed model consists of a SHA256 encrypted blockchain. Each block of the proposed model consists of 2 key fields i.e newsPiece and uploaderName apart from the hashes and the timestamp. The newsPiece component can be uploaded by anyone. Open access is provided to all users to upload their desired newsPiece. The security that is provided to users by using cryptographic principles can make it widely popular and globally trusted. Public key cryptography is an integral component of blockchain. A public-private pair of keys is generated in the blockchain through high-order cryptographic algorithms. Effective security is maintained by keeping the private key secure whereas the public key may be given for access purposes. Such cryptographically encrypted security is used in the proposed weighted majority voting model. For more information on the security of blockchain technology, we refer readers to some informative survey articles on blockchain security and privacy \\[ [34](/article/10.1007/s10586-021-03361-w#ref-CR34 \"Li, X., Jiang, P., Chen, T., Luo, X., Wen, Q.: A survey on the security of blockchain systems. Future Gen. Comput. Syst. 107, 841\u2013853 (2020)\"), [35](/article/10.1007/s10586-021-03361-w#ref-CR35 \"Lin, I.C., Liao, T.C.: A survey of blockchain security issues and challenges. IJ Netw.

The newsPiece, uploaderName, hashes, and timestamp determine the generated hash. These hashes are immutable and are regenerative. Any change to the input data changes the output. Hence, any change to the input data means a complete change in the flow of the blocks of the chain. The hashes of all the block change from the block in which the change was made onwards.\n\nProof of Trust integrates trust components and is widely adopted in the service industry, and crowdsourcing environments as it can address the unfaithful behaviour of members of the public service network \\[ [36](#ref-CR36 \"Alfandi, O., Otoum, S., Jararweh, Y.: Blockchain solution for iot-based critical infrastructures: Byzantine fault tolerance.

The feedback mechanism is incorporated so that experts trust score is updated after each judgment of the newsPiece. In comparison to contemporary models of fake news detection, ProBlock offers a highly credible trust-based voting system in which multi-media of any format including images, videos, texts, sounds can be analyzed by verified reviewers, and scores can be generated to determine their veracity.

The blockchain network is successfully able to furnish the 500 test blocks in 4.87 ms. The SHA256 hashing algorithm operates at 100 megabytes per second, For every generated block, each reviewer takes to cast their respective votes depending on the complexity of the item under consideration and the level of confidence they hold in their vote. For sake of simplicity, the test of voting was conducted on 100 of the 500 test blocks generated. Taking the average of the time taken by reviewers to cast their vote over 40 newsPieces and the time taken to validate those votes to approve the newsPiece is roughly 108 s per block.\n\nThe analysis of the proposed system is done by increasing the number of blocks and by increasing the number of reviewers. As the voting is taking place in a distributed environment i.e all the reviews can concurrently vote, increasing the number of reviewers for a newsPiece only shows a variation in the time taken for validation and computation as demonstrated clearly in Fig.\u00a0[4](/article/10.1007/s10586-021-03361-w#Fig4). On varying the number of reviewers voting on the same newsPiece, we obtain the following rate of increase in time taken to validate. The time is taken increases from 107.22 to 136.45 s.\n\nIn the second analysis, we introduce variation in throughput of the system with an increase in the number of blocks. The number of reviewers is kept at 5 and the number of newsPieces is increased, thereby increasing the length of the chain. The results are depicted in Fig.\u00a0[5](/article/10.1007/s10586-021-03361-w#Fig5) where the increase in time taken for validation increases from 111.81 to 112.66 s. 2 reference points, 70% (0.70) and 30% (0.30) are taken for measuring the Accuracy of the model. All newsPieces with probability percentages greater than \\\\(70\\\\%\\\\) are considered genuine. The usage of the ProBit model enables us to improve the accuracy of the model because, in the ProBit model, the inverse standard normal distribution of the probability is modelled as a linear combination of the predictors. ProBlock shows an accuracy of \\\\(82.79\\\\%\\\\) for detecting genuine newsPieces which is a significant improvement to the Non-ProBit based methods of probability calculation. These results are all depicted in Table\u00a0[6](/article/10.1007/s10586-021-03361-w#Tab6). We can see clearly in Table\u00a0[6](/article/10.1007/s10586-021-03361-w#Tab6) the strong results garnered by ProBlock\n\n**Table 6 Results of ProBit model vs. no ProBit model**\n\n[Full size table](/article/10.1007/s10586-021-03361-w/tables/6)\n\n## 6 Conclusion and future work\n\nThis paper aims at providing a comprehensive model for fake news detection. The proposed model is advantageous over existing approaches in many dimensions. First, it can handle any type of news piece whether it is text, image, video, or audio format. The authenticity of the model is high as it considers expert knowledge for testing news pieces, and a dynamic weight voting approach is used that considers the credibility of reviewers. News pieces are further classified as fake or genuine using the ProBit model. The considered approach has outperformed the simple weighted approach. For a secured and faster implementation of the model, we consider the use of a distributed ledger. The whole model is implemented using blockchain technology which allows simultaneous voting and immediate feedback to reduce scalability issues. By analyzing both qualitative and quantitative results provided in the paper, we show that by taking into consideration factors regarding the credibility of reviewers through the ProBit model over a distributed platform like a blockchain, the probabilistic analysis of the veracity of news items can be done with higher accuracy (Table\u00a0[6](/article/10.1007/s10586-021-03361-w#Tab6)). In terms of future directions, the given model of fake news detection through a probabilistic analysis over a blockchain can be made more efficient by deploying a greater number of servers in the network. The model can be implemented on the back-end of a front-end web application to be used more widely by a greater number of people.\n\n## Data availability\n\nThe datasets generated during and/or analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.\n\n## Notes\n\n1.

The authors, including Ayushi Jain and Deepti Mehrotra, aim to address the issue of road accidents in India, where the frequency of such events is alarmingly high. The paper discusses the utilization of data mining techniques such as K-means clustering and decision tree classifiers to analyze and identify accident-prone areas, analyze contributing factors, and enhance road safety measures. Through clustering, the authors were able to classify regions with similar accident characteristics, allowing for targeted interventions. Furthermore, decision trees were employed to reveal the primary causes of accidents in specific regions, highlighting the importance of selecting relevant independent variables for forecasting and prevention models. The study emphasizes the comparative effectiveness of various machine learning methodologies, including Random Forest, AdaBoost, and Support Vector Machine (SVM), as foundational tools in the analyzed datasets, aiming for improved accuracy in predicting road accidents and understanding their underlying causes. Ultimately, the research aims to provide actionable insights that can guide policymakers and traffic management agencies in reducing the incidence of road traffic accidents across India.",

In this paper, we study the cities of a different division of Bangladesh against the contributing causes and find out the reasons behind this number of road accidents to draw effective outcomes to smooth road safety in the country. First, we used clustering to find out similar objects to find out the accident-prone area for the experimental dataset on the basis of vulnerability \\[5\\]. Later, we applied the decision tree classifier to present the region-wise dominant causes of accident \\[6\\]. ...\n\n... Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), Deviance Information Criterion (DIC), and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) are some of the measures used to choose the most satisfactory model that capable of taking consideration 0the probabilities of the posterior model \\[5\\]. To construct a road crash analysis and predict the model, explanatory (independent) variables selection plays an important role. ...\n\n...

The traffic safety of the roadway is an essential concern not only for transportation governing agencies but also for citizens of our country. For safe driving suggestions, the important thing is to find the variables that are tensed to relate to the fatal accidents that are occurring often. In this paper, we create a model using a machine learning approach on the countrywide traffic accident dataset of Bangladesh as an aim to address this problem. The model also helps out to find the diversity of the data by grouping similar objects together to find the accident-prone areas in the country concerning different accident factors as well as detects the cooperation between these factors and causalities.\n\n[View](publication/346809265_Accidental_Prone_Area_Detection_in_Bangladesh_using_Machine_Learning_Model)\n\nShow abstract\n\n...

This study explored the impact of a motorcycle vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) warning system on road safety through a field trial of a Motorcycle Safety Warning System (MSWS). This study used principal component analysis, K-means, and ordinal logistic regression to explore the effects of the MSWS. After system activation, the road safety level (RSL) improved at 50% of the field trial sites. This study provides a reference for evaluating RSLs through the composite index of this study and verifies that the V2I warning signs of the MSWS provide a certain degree of improvement of motorcycle traffic safety. A V2I system like the MSWS can be used to collect data on driving behaviours in a short period for safety effect analysis, as compared to crash data, which require an extended period. In addition, the traffic behaviour data collected by a V2I system can also be used to identify potential high crash risk locations.

He can unexpectedly veer off the lane, colliding with an obstacle or causing a car to overturn. In this paper, we present a low-cost, non-intrusive, more accurate, and better solution for detecting driver drowsiness in real-time in real-world driving conditions, whenever the drowsiness is detected, the system activates an audible alarm to alert the driver before he falls asleep. In the proposed method, we used the most important facial components that are considered the most effective for sleepiness. We used the Viola-Jones algorithm to detect the driver's face and eyes area. Then we inserted the resulting image into the deep convolutional neural network (DenseNet 201).

The prevention and quick detection of an accident is the priority in saving the lives of human beings. Advances in technologies like the internet of things (IoT) make life better for everyone but adding technologies to control and manage traffic in a smarter way is a big challenge. Accident prevention and detection system (APDS) is developed to provide real time support to the people through IoT. The APDS aims to provide an early solution to day-to-day traffic incidents. The prevention of accidents is more important as vehicles are controlled by human beings. The parameters, like change in speed, human body part movements, overtaking, rule braking, etc., are responsible for the accident. It can be managed or controlled using some rule-based techniques. The abnormal behavior of each parameter can be identified by continuous monitoring, and reporting the same well in before may reduce the occurrence of an accident. Once an accident occurs, the detail information of accident data are shared with end-users with some proper authentication. The information sharing is established through machine-to-machine (M2M) communication. The end-users will get all the data regarding location, time of the accident, and many more details by accessing the web link through the internet.\n\n[View](publication/348227621_A_User_Specific_APDS_for_Smart_City_Applications)\n\nShow abstract\n\n...

It is time-consuming and laborious to study the properties of hazardous chemicals individually for systematic accident prevention because of the wide variety of hazardous chemicals and conditions resulting in accidents. Moreover, accidents have numerous causes, and the relationships among the causative factors are complex. It is a problem that is difficult to accurately identify the effects of correlations among accident factors and determine the laws governing accident occurrence. In this paper, we propose a generic method of hazardous chemical accident prevention based on K-means clustering analysis of incident information to illustrate how to solve the problems. A database of hazardous chemical incidents was constructed, and a K-means clustering algorithm was adopted to classify the incidents. The numbers of occurrences and frequencies of the words in the textual descriptions of the consequences, processes, and causes of hazardous chemical incidents were counted and calculated using a class-based method. For words with a high frequency, risk scenarios were constructed, checklist items of newly revealed dangers were developed, and a system for systematic risk assessment and accident prevention was established. Finally, the information on hazardous material transportation incidents in the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration database of the U.S. Department of Transportation from 2009 to 2018 had been taken as an example to illustrate the method application. The results demonstrate that the proposed method of hazardous chemical accident prevention can be used to improve accident classification. The classification results make it possible to determine the optimal sequence of key targets on which to focus and the requirements for accident prevention and formulate preventive measures. Thus, they provide a technical basis for accident prevention.\n\n[View](publication/347155966_Hazardous_Chemical_Accident_Prevention_Based_on_K-Means_Clustering_Analysis_of_Incident_Information)\n\nShow abstract\n\n...

It is now a more challenging task to deal with existing traffic systems with massive traffic. In the current scenario, the Internet of things (IoT) based solutions will make the transport system more intelligent. This solution will help to reduce congestion and increase the safety of everyday people. Fast reporting of driving abnormalities 1 will help in preventing the life of the person involved in traffic crashes. Traffic crashes can be addressed using sensors, audio, and video-based analysis. The work presented here is a fast information sharing system with the date and time of the event, the detailed geographical location with Google map URL, speed, and the path traced using global positioning system (GPS) data. The fast reporting system uses various sensors to collect the vehicle data and notifies the driving abnormality, whenever any abnormal situation occurs. It will help the rescue team, insurance people, or relatives for easy navigation to the desired location. The limitations of communication bandwidth requirement and the powerful central processor may reduce detection performance; however, fast reporting could save many precious lives from danger. 1 In this article, the abnormality is the behavior of the vehicle when it meets an accident while on the move.\n\n[View](publication/345324814_An_IoT-Based_Intimation_and_Path_Tracing_of_a_Vehicle_Involved_in_Road_Traffic_Crashes)\n\nShow abstract\n\n...

Given the significance of the subject, reducing the harm caused by traffic accidents has shifted its focus to finding the root causes of incidents on the road. On the other hand, it is impractical to analyze the components in this regard due to the exponential growth of data volume. Despite everything that has been done so far to increase road safety in India, many areas continue to be vulnerable to these flaws. Due to the diversity of these vulnerability-causing factors, a thorough analysis is required in order to significantly reduce the worrying numbers. The aim of this paper is to use data mining and machine learning approaches to help develop a model using LR and RF that not only smooths out the heterogeneity of the data by grouping like objects together to identify the regions of the nation that are most likely to experience accidents in relation to various accident-factors, but also assists in establishing the relationship between these parameters, factors, and casualties. The outcomes of data mining will assist businesses like transportation in exploring the police information system\u2019s accident data, finding trends, forecasting future behavior, and making wise judgments to reduce accidents.\n\n[View](publication/376547152_Predictive_Analysis_of_Road_Accidents_Using_Data_Mining_and_Machine_Learning)\n\nShow abstract\n\n[Using Variational Encoders to Enhance Classification in Indian Roads Analysis](publication/372975352_Using_Variational_Encoders_to_Enhance_Classification_in_Indian_Roads_Analysis)\n\nConference Paper\n\n- Jun 2023\n\n- [![Ayush Thakur](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAADUlEQVR42mN89OjNfwAJDwOxHEacwgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)Ayush Thakur](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ayush-Thakur-6)\n- [K.A.

The road infrastructure does not have time to develop at the same pace, it gives rise to problematic situations in the field of organization and road safety. In order to solve these problems, an information managerial system has been developed. It aggregates information from several databases (information on traffic intensity, statistics of road traffic accidents, location and characteristics of infrastructure objects). Decisions are made on the basis of multivariate data analysis and computer experiments on simulated micro-models of the road network problem areas. The practical significance of the system lies in the ability to calculate the effects of the implementation of the proposed solutions at the stage of development of projects for the modernization and reconstruction of the road network parameters. The system can also be used for operational management decisions in the event of extreme situations in the city transport system (lockdown, public events).\n\n[View](publication/349149732_Mobility_and_Road_Safety_Improvement_by_Optimizing_Smart_City_Infrastructure_Parameters_A_Case_Study)\n\nShow abstract\n\n[Machine Learning Approach Towards Road Accident Analysis in India](publication/348222653_Machine_Learning_Approach_Towards_Road_Accident_Analysis_in_India)\n\nChapter\n\n- Jan 2021\n\n- [Shruti Singhal](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Shruti-Singhal-2187699157)\n- [Bhavini Priyamvada](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Bhavini-Priyamvada-2187674889)\n- [![Rachna Jain](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAADUlEQVR42mN89OjNfwAJDwOxHEacwgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)Rachna Jain](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Rachna-Jain-12)\n- [Muskan Chawla](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Muskan-Chawla-2174091544)\n\nThis paper aims to study, compare and analyse the performance of six major machine learning techniques to better understand the occurrence of traffic accidents.

However, heterogeneous nature of road accident data makes the analysis task difficult. Data segmentation has been used widely to overcome this heterogeneity of the accident data. In this paper, we proposed a framework that used K-modes clustering technique as a preliminary task for segmentation of 11,574 road accidents on road network of Dehradun (India) between 2009 and 2014 (both included). Next, association rule mining are used to identify the various circumstances that are associated with the occurrence of an accident for both the entire data set (EDS) and the clusters identified by K-modes clustering algorithm. The findings of cluster based analysis and entire data set analysis are then compared. The results reveal that the combination of k mode clustering and association rule mining is very inspiring as it produces important information that would remain hidden if no segmentation has been performed prior to generate association rules. Further a trend analysis have also been performed for each clusters and EDS accidents which finds different trends in different cluster whereas a positive trend is shown by EDS. Trend analysis also shows that prior segmentation of accident data is very important before analysis.\n\n[View](publication/284282571_A_data_mining_framework_to_analyze_road_accident_data)\n\nShow abstract\n\n[Clustering of Districts in Erzurum by Number of Injury](publication/281409590_Clustering_of_Districts_in_Erzurum_by_Number_of_Injury)\n\nArticle\n\nFull-text available\n\n- Dec 2015\n\n- [![Ahmet Atalay](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAADUlEQVR42mN89OjNfwAJDwOxHEacwgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)Ahmet Atalay](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ahmet-Atalay)\n- [![Ahmet Tortum](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAADUlEQVR42mN89OjNfwAJDwOxHEacwgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)Ahmet Tortum](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ahmet-Tortum)\n- [![H\u00fcmeyra Bolakar](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAADUlEQVR42mN89OjNfwAJDwOxHEacwgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)H\u00fcmeyra Bolakar](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Huemeyra-Bolakar)\n\nIn this study, the number of injuries from road traffic accidents for each district was identified in Erzurum, Turkey during the years of 2012 and 2013. Clustering analysis was made according to these rates by using both classical k-means and fuzzy c-means technique. Districts were divided into five clusters by analysis conducted with these two techniques. Districts with the highest injury risk were determined, and the results obtained were compared. In this study, it was observed that the result of fuzzy c-means technique is equal to the result of k-means technique. Moreover, it was determined that geographical information systems are advantageous to show and understand the results of the thematic maps. \uf020\n\n[View](publication/281409590_Clustering_of_Districts_in_Erzurum_by_Number_of_Injury)\n\nShow abstract\n\n[Analysis of Factors of Road Traffic Accidents using Enhanced Decision Tree Algorithm](publication/295256329_Analysis_of_Factors_of_Road_Traffic_Accidents_using_Enhanced_Decision_Tree_Algorithm)\n\nArticle\n\n- Feb 2016\n\n- [Naina Mahajan](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Naina-Mahajan-2099831384)\n- [Bikram Pal](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Bikram-Pal-2099848949)\n\n[View](publication/295256329_Analysis_of_Factors_of_Road_Traffic_Accidents_using_Enhanced_Decision_Tree_Algorithm)\n\n[Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques](publication/220688795_Data_Mining_Concepts_and_Techniques)\n\nBook\n\n- Jan 2000\n\n- [![Jiawei Han](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAADUlEQVR42mN89OjNfwAJDwOxHEacwgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)Jiawei Han](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jiawei-Han-10)\n- [Micheline Kamber](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Micheline-Kamber-3240714)\n\nThis is the third edition of the premier professional reference on the subject of data mining, expanding and updating the previous market leading edition.

Kohonen neural networks are applied to a database of pedestrian fatal accidents occurred during the four-year period between 2003 and 2006. Results show the existence of five pedestrian accident patterns: (i) elderly pedestrians crossing on crosswalks mostly far from intersections in metropolitan areas; (ii) pedestrians crossing suddenly or from hidden places and colliding with two-wheel vehicles on urban road sections; (iii) male pedestrians crossing at night and being hit by four-wheel vehicles on rural road sections; (iv) young male pedestrians crossing at night wide road sections in both urban and rural areas; (v) children and teenagers crossing road sections in small rural communities. From the perspective of preventive measures, results suggest the necessity of designing education and information campaigns for road users as well as allocating resources for infrastructural interventions and law enforcement in order to address the identified major problems.\n\n[View](publication/51776517_Mapping_patterns_of_pedestrian_fatal_accidents_in_Israel)\n\nShow abstract\n\n[Survey of Classification Techniques in Data Mining](publication/44259642_Survey_of_Classification_Techniques_in_Data_Mining)\n\nArticle\n\n- Mar 2009\n\n- [Thair Nu Phyu](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Thair-Nu-Phyu-784260)\n\n[View](publication/44259642_Survey_of_Classification_Techniques_in_Data_Mining)\n\nA comparative study of classification algorithm using accident data\n\n- A Priyanka\n- K Sathiyakumari\n\nCluster analysis for road accident investigation\n\n- M N Postorino\n- G M L Sarne\n\nComparison of different classification techniques using different datasets\n\n- V Vaithiyanathan\n- K Rajeswari\n- Kapil Tajane\n- Rahul Pitale\n\nEfficient Analysis of Traffic Accident using Mining Techniques\n\n- S Vigneswaran\n- A Joseph\n- E Rajamanickam\n\nIdentification of hotspots road locations of traffic accidents with pedestrian in urban areas\n\n- Svetlana Ba\u010dkali\u0107\n- Bo\u010dko Matovi\u0107\n- Dragan Jovanovi\u0107\n\n**We and our partners use cookies** \u2715\n\nBy using this site, you consent to the processing of your personal data, the storing of cookies on your device, and the use of similar technologies for personalization, ads, analytics, etc. For more information or to opt out, see our [Privacy Policy](https://www.researchgate.net/privacy-policy)",

It takes the advantages of crossover and mutation mask-fill operators together with a Boolean based procedure in two phases to guide the search process from _i_ th generation to ( _i_ +1)th generation. Crossover and mutation mask-fill operations are performed to generate the proportionate amount of population in each generation. A parser has been implemented checks the validity of the grammar rules based on the acceptance or rejection of training data on the positive and negative strings of the language. Experiments are conducted on collection of context free and regular languages. Minimum description length principle has been used to generate a corpus of positive and negative samples as appropriate for the experiment. It was observed that the BMOGA produces successive generations of individuals, computes their fitness at each step and chooses the best when reached to threshold (termination) condition. As presented approach was found effective in handling premature convergence therefore results are compared with the approaches used to alleviate premature convergence. The analysis showed that the BMOGA performs better as compared to other algorithms such as: random offspring generation approach, dynamic allocation of reproduction operators, elite mating pool approach and the simple genetic algorithm. The term success ratio is used as a quality measure and its value shows the effectiveness of the BMOGA. Statistical tests indicate superiority of the BMOGA over other existing approaches implemented.\n\n## Graphical abstract\n\n![](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S1568494615006249-fx1.jpg)\n\n1.

It was extensively studied \\[6\\], \\[46\\], \\[47\\], \\[48\\], \\[49\\], \\[50\\], \\[63\\] due to its wide fields of application to solve practical problems in a variety of different fields, which includes a compilation and translation, human machine interaction, graphic languages, design of programming language, data mining, computational biology, natural language processing, software engineering and machine learning, etc.\n\nThe first learning model was proposed by Gold in 1967 \\[26\\]. Gold addressed the question \u201c _Is the information sufficient to determine which of the possible languages is the unknown language_?\u201d \\[26\\]. It was shown that an inference algorithm can identify an unknown language in the limit from complete information in a finite number of steps. The key issue with the Gold's approach is that there is no information present with inference algorithm about identification of correct grammar because it is always possible that next sample may invalidate the previous hypothesis. Angluin \\[58\\] proposed \u201c _tell tales_\u201d (a unique string makes the difference between languages) to avoid the drawback. Although Gold \\[26\\] laid the foundation of grammar inference, Bunke and Sanfeliu \\[38\\] presented the first usable grammatical inference algorithm in syntactic pattern recognition community with the aim of classification and analysis of patterns, classification of biological sequence, character recognition, etc. The main drawback of this algorithm was it only dealt with positive data, was unable to deal with noisy data, did not fit exactly into a finite state machine and therefore good formal language theories were lost. Stevenson and Cordy \\[39\\], \\[40\\] explain that theorists and empiricists are the two main groups contributing in the field of grammar inference. Language classes and learning models were considered by theorists group to set up the boundaries of what is learnable and how efficiently it can be learned. On the other hand empiricists group dealt with a practical problem by solving it; finally they have made a significant contribution in grammatical inference. Teacher and query is another learning model, where a teacher also referred to as an Oracle knows the target languages and is capable to answer particular types of questions/queries from the inference algorithm. Six types of queries were described by Angluin \\[59\\], two of which are membership and equivalence queries that have significant impact on learning. In case of membership queries, the inference algorithm presents either \u201c _yes_\u201d or \u201c _no_\u201d as answer to the oracle, whereas oracle receives \u201c _yes_\u201d if the hypothesis is true and \u201c _no_\u201d otherwise by inference algorithm. Valiant \\[60\\] presented _Probably Approximately Correct_ (PAC) Learning Model, which takes the advantages of both identification of the limit and _teachers and queries_ learning models. The PAC learning model is different from other two former learning models because of two reasons: first it does not guarantee exact identification with certainty, second compromises between accuracy and certainty. The problem with the PAC model is that the inference algorithm must learn in polynomial time under all distributions, but it is believed to be too strict in reality. These problems occur because many apparently simple classes are either known to be NP-hard or at least not known to be polynomial learnable for all distributions \\[39\\]. To mitigate this issue, Li et al. \\[61\\] proposed inference algorithm to consider the simple distribution only. Apart from the above popular learning models, many researchers explain the suitability of the neural network for grammar inference problem. Neural network shown the ability to maintain a temporal internal state like a short term memory \\[40\\]. In case of the neural network, a set of inputs, and their corresponding outputs (Yes: string is in the target language, No: otherwise) and a defined function need to learn, which describes those input-output pairs \\[40\\]. Alex et al. \\[54\\] conducted experiments for handwriting recognition using neural network and it was explained that this network has the capability to predict subsequent elements from an input sequence of elements. Cleeremans et al. \\[53\\] implemented a special case of a recurrent network presented by Elman \\[55\\] known a simple recurrent network to approximate a DFA (deterministic finite automata). Delgado and Pegalajar \\[56\\] presented a multi-objective genetic algorithm to analyze the optimal size of a recurrent neural network to learn positive and negative examples. Authors of \\[56\\] utilized the merits of self organizing map to determine the automation, once the training is completed. Although neural network is widely used for grammar inference since it was found good at simulating an unknown function, but it was observed that there is no way to reconstruct the function from the connections in a trained network \\[40\\]. A detailed survey of various grammar inference algorithms is presented in \\[6\\], \\[39\\], \\[40\\], \\[51\\], \\[52\\], \\[57\\]. Inductive inference is the process of making generalization from the input (string). Wyard \\[3\\] presented the impact of different grammar representation and experimental result show that the evolutionary algorithm (EA) using standard context free grammar (CFG) (Backus Naur Form (BNF)) outperformed others. Thanaruk and Okumaru \\[27\\] classified grammar induction methods into three categories, namely; supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised depending on the type of required data. Javed et al. \\[28\\] presented genetic programming (GP) based approach to learn CFG. The work presented in \\[28\\] was the extension of the work done in \\[3\\] by utilizing grammar specific heuristic operator. In addition, better construction of the initial population was suggested. Choubey and Kharat \\[29\\] presented a sequential structuring approach to perform coding and decoding of binary coded chromosomes into terminal and non-terminals and vice versa. A CFG induction library was presented using the GA contains various Java classes to perform grammar inference process \\[30\\], \\[9\\]. The proposed approach for grammar induction is discussed in Section 2.\n\nSection 3 discusses an important issue in GA known as premature convergence. In evolutionary search, the diversity (difference among individual at the genotype or phenotype levels) decreases as the population converges to a local optimum. It is the situation when an extraordinary individual takes over a significant proportion of finite population and leads towards an undesirable convergence. Diverse population is a prerequisite for exploration in order to avoid premature convergence to local optima \\[44\\], \\[64\\]. On the other hand, promoting diversity in an evolutionary process is good where exploitation is needed. Hence, to reach to the global solution and explore the search space adequately, maintaining population diversity is very important. Also, it had been explained clearly that degree of population diversity is one of the main cause of premature convergence \\[42\\], \\[43\\]. It is necessary to select the best solution of the current generation to direct the GA to reach to the global optimum. The tendency to select the best member of the current generation is known as selective pressure. It is also a key factor that plays an important role in maintaining genetic diversity. A proper balancing is required between genetic diversity and selection pressure to direct the GA search to converge in a time effective manner and to achieve global optima. High selective pressure reduces the genetic diversity; hence in this situation premature convergence can occur while the little selective pressure prohibits the GA to converge to an optimum in reasonable time. An approach to increase the population size is not sufficient to alleviate premature convergence because any increase in population size will add twofold cost both extra computing time and number of generations to converge on global optima. Applying mutation alone converts GA search into a random search whereas crossover alone generates a sub-optimal solution. Also, applying selection, crossover and mutation together may result the GA search to noise tolerant hill climbing approach. Several approaches to handle the premature convergence are suggested \\[41\\]. Although these approaches address the premature convergence in their ways by maintaining population diversity, these methods suffer with its own strengths and weaknesses. Pandey et al. \\[41\\] presented a detailed and comprehensive comparison of various premature convergence handling approaches on the basis of their merits, demerits and other important factors.\n\nThe focus of this paper is towards development of a grammar induction tool and addressing premature convergence in GA. An effort is made towards utilizing the applicability of the bit masking oriented data structures to apply mask-fill reproduction operators and the Boolean based procedure. The diversity of the population is created through the Boolean based procedure during offspring generation, which helps in avoiding premature convergence in a grammar inference problem using the GA. A learning system uses a finite set of examples and to train the system sufficient training set is needed, which can be achieved employing generalization and specialization. Authors \\[65\\], \\[66\\], \\[67\\] discussed the importance of generalization and specialization for the learning systems. It was discussed that overgeneralization is a major issue in the identification of grammars for formal languages from the positive data \\[40\\] \\[65\\]. Therefore, the minimum description length principle is used to address this issue (discussed in Section 2.4). This paper makes five main contributions, as enumerated below:\n\n- (a).\nThe four steps of grammar induction are presented. An example is considered to illustrate the step by step process of grammar induction.\n\n- (b).\nA sequential mapping of chromosome is presented. In addition, the applicability of the parser is shown helps in removing insufficiencies and decide acceptance and rejection of training data.\n\n- (c).\nAn algorithm \u201c _BMOGA_\u201d is presented for CFG induction from the positive and negative corpus. Furthermore, we show the crossover and mutation mask-fill reproduction operators and detailed procedure of the new offspring generation.\n\n- (d).\nApplicability of the minimum description length principle is shown in CFG induction.\n\n- (e).\nWe bring to light the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm by comparing it with existing algorithms such as a simple genetic algorithm (SGA), random offspring generation genetic algorithm (ROGGA), elite mating pool genetic algorithm (EMPGA) and dynamic allocation of reproduction operators (DARO).\n\n\nThe simulation model for grammar induction is discussed in Section 4 followed by concluding remarks for the paper in Section 5. Lastly but not the least important literatures for grammar inference and approaches to alleviate premature convergence is presented in \u201cReferences\u201d.\n\n## Section snippets\n\n## Proposed approach for grammar induction\n\nEarlier work conducted shows the relatively simple and deterministic CFG has been inferred \\[3\\], \\[9\\], \\[10\\] using the GA's. A grammar induction library for CFG induction is presented \\[9\\], \\[30\\], which consists of a four Java classes and dealt only with simple languages. A case study on grammar induction is presented in \\[10\\], which utilizes the basics of the GA that uses simple crossover (one and two points) and mutation (bit inversion) operators for grammar induction. This section presents a\n\n## Other approaches for premature convergence\n\nThe study is conducted on four different algorithms: a simple genetic algorithm (SGA), random offspring generation genetic algorithm (ROGGA), elite mating pool genetic algorithm (EMPGA) and dynamic allocation of reproduction operator (DARO). ROGGA, EMPGA and DARO are mainly proposed to address premature convergence. The SGA is given to lay down the basic understanding of the GA, whereas EMPGA and DARO algorithms are chosen because these approaches were implemented on CFG induction problems \\[25\\].\n\n## Simulation model\n\nIn order to evaluate the performance of the BMOGA experiments have been conducted, which utilize CM and MM for the CFG induction using a set of positive and negative corpora. Java programming on Net Beans IDE 7.0.1, Intel Core\u2122 2processor (2.8GHz) with 2GB RAM have been used. Context Free, and Regular languages have been chosen with varying patterns of 0's and 1's is given in Table 1. Table 2 shows the parameters used for the implementation of the proposed algorithm. The MDLP has been used to\n\n## Conclusions\n\nIn this paper, we have presented the BMOGA, when compared with other approaches such as SGA, ROGGA, EMPGA and DARO is found effective for the CFG induction. The analysis explains the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Although the execution time required is higher but it showed promising results in terms of APR and success ratio. It was observed that the BMOGA outperformed SGA, ROGGA, DARO and showed better results than the EMPGA. Though the execution time varies from language to language,\n\n**Hari Mohan Pandey** is major in Computer Science and Engineering and pursuing Ph.D. in Language Processing and Evolutionary Algorithms.

Previous studies \\[8\u201311\\] have recognized the importance of the mask-fill reproduction operators in GA. Mask-fill reproduction operators utilizes BMODS to perform crossover and mutation operations and then a Boolean based procedure that generates an offspring.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow abstract\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo be successful, a search algorithm needs to balance exploration and exploitation. In Genetic Algorithms (GAs) this is achieved through proportionate selection of individuals and reproduction operators. GAs can suffer premature convergence, when the diversity of the population decreases over time and search gets trapped in a local optimum, returning a very poor quality solution. Mask-fill reproduction operators utilizes bit-masking oriented data structure (BMODS) that maintains a good ratio between exploration and exploitation. Mask-fill reproduction operators have been utilized in various applications, but the exploration and exploitation ability of mask-fill reproduction operators have not been compared against other reproduction operators. This paper describes a rigorous and practical statistical methodology for the exploratory analysis of the mask-fill reproduction operators. First, the issues of robust experimental design and setting the control parameters for implementing a GA is addressed. Second, the impact of various reproduction operator combinations are analysed. In this study, three crossover operators and five mutation operators are considered which creates fifteen crossover\u2013mutation operator combinations. Third, the methodology is demonstrated by considering grammatical inference (GI) problem as domain of enquiry. A hybrid genetic algorithm integrated with Sequitur algorithm (GAWS) is proposed for GI. Numerical results are presented to describe the effect of crossover\u2013mutation operator combinations. The performance of the proposed GAWS is compared against the state-of-the-art algorithms. Statistical test are conducted to determine the performance significance of both crossover\u2013mutation operator combinations and the proposed GAWS algorithm.\n\n- ### [GAPSO-H: A hybrid approach towards optimizing the cluster based routing in wireless sensor network](/science/article/pii/S2210650220304259)\n\n\n\n2021, Swarm and Evolutionary Computation\n\n\n\nShow abstract\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have left an indelible mark on the lives of all by aiding in various sectors such as agriculture, education, manufacturing, monitoring of the environment, etc. Nevertheless, because of the wireless existence, the sensor node batteries cannot be replaced when deployed in a remote or unattended area. Several researches are therefore documented to extend the node's survival time. While cluster-based routing has contributed significantly to address this issue, there is still room for improvement in the choice of the cluster head (CH) by integrating critical parameters. Furthermore, primarily the focus had been on either the selection of CH or the data transmission among the nodes. The meta-heuristic methods are the promising approach to acquire the optimal network performance. In this paper, the \u2018CH selection\u2019 and \u2018sink mobility-based data transmission\u2019, both are optimized through a hybrid approach that consider the genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm respectively for each task. The robust behavior of GA helps in the optimized the CH selection, whereas, PSO helps in finding the optimized route for sink mobility. It is observed through the simulation analysis and results statistics that the proposed GAPSO-H (GA and PSO based hybrid) method outperform the state-of-art algorithms at various levels of performance metrics.\n\n- ### [State of the Art on Grammatical Inference Using Evolutionary Method](/science/article/pii/B9780128221167010016)\n\n\n\n2021, State of the Art on Grammatical Inference Using Evolutionary Method\n\n- ### [Secure medical data transmission using a fusion of bit mask oriented genetic algorithm, encryption and steganography](/science/article/pii/S0167739X20303848)\n\n\n\n2020, Future Generation Computer Systems\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCitation Excerpt :\n\n\n\nBMODS uses mask-fill crossover and mutation operations. The description of BMODS is presented in \\[6\\]. BMOGA supports three crossover operators (single cut mask-fill crossover, bit-by-bit mask-fill crossover and local cut mask-fill crossover) and mutation mask-fill (a special bit flip mutation operator).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow abstract\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis paper presents a bit mask oriented genetic algorithm based secure medical data transmission mechanism. A bit mask oriented genetic algorithm (BMOGA) is utilized to reduce the replication of medical tests data which are transferred across organizations. Medical data is considered very sensitive, therefore secure medical data transmission is must. BMOGA is a variant of the traditional genetic algorithm. Literature reveals that it can avoid premature convergence \u2013 a situation when optimization algorithms get stuck at local optimum. BOMGA utilizes Boolean based mask-fill operators and performs reproduction operations in two different phases that helps to avoid premature convergence. Cryptographic features are integrated with the BMOGA for secure data transmission. The encrypted data is embedded into the medical images through 1-level and 2-level Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). The reverse process of the BMOGA is implemented for the extraction of secret message from the encrypted one. Numerical experiments are conducted to determine the performance of the proposed algorithm. Results reveals that the proposed algorithm is capable of secure data transmission. Performance comparison is done with the state-of-the-art algorithm with respect to the datasets. Comparative results indicated the superiority of the proposed algorithm in terms of various statistical measures such as peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR), correlation, structural content (SC), structure similarity (SSIM) and mean square error (MSE) to report the results.\n\n- ### [Performance Evaluation of Selection Methods of Genetic Algorithm and Network Security Concerns](/science/article/pii/S1877050916000065)\n\n\n\n2016, Physics Procedia\n\n\n\nShow abstract\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecurity is the prominent concern for the network and maintaining security is highly recommended.

It is a population based\n\nheuristic search algorithm \\[4\\]. Evolutionary algorithms have two\n\nsubclasses, namely Genetic Algorithms (GAs) and Genetic\n\nProgramming (GP). In genetic algorithms, the element of the\n\nsearch space is binary string, or any other elementary type \\[34\\].\n\nWe can quickly get a solution for the optimization of hard\n\nproblems, using genetic algorithms \\[5\\]. Optimization is the\n\nprocess of modifying the inputs or characteristics of a device. It is\n\na mathematical process to obtain the minimum or maximum\n\noutput. In genetic algorithms, the output is the fitness function of\n\nthe system, whereas the input to the optimization process is the\n\ncost function, or objective function, or fitness function. Roughly\n\nspeaking, a GA adopts a group of solutions to the problem at\n\nhand, in the fashion of the natural species. GA evolves a\n\npopulation of randomly generated individuals (where each\n\nrepresents a solution to the problem) through iterations, by\n\napplying genetic operations, such as crossover, mutation and\n\nothers \\[34\\]. Standard Genetic Algorithm (SGA) is a powerful\n\nsearch and optimization tool. However, it does have some\n\nproblems.\n\n\uf0d8The basic problem with genetic algorithms is the lack of\n\nlocal search, and difficulty in handling the premature\n\nconvergence \\[6\\].\n\n\uf0d8Another problem is that it takes a long time in execution\n\nwhenever applied to big and complex problems \\[7\\].\n\nThere are many varieties of GAs with variations in standard\n\ngenetic operations, in order to address various engineering and\n\nindustrial problems. A new branch of GAs has also been\n\ndeveloped, called Parallel Genetic Algorithm (PGA) \\[8\\] \\[9\\]. In\n\nPGA, a number of subpopulations are evolved alongside each\n\nother, facilitating the possibility of distributing the execution to\n\nmultiple processors, and increasing performance.\n\nThe grammar induction process plays an important role, not only\n\nin the field of theoretical linguistics but also in engineering\n\nproblems. The application domain of grammar induction includes\n\nareas, such as pattern recognition \\[10\\] \\[11\\], information retrieval,\n\nspeech recognition, machine translation, and the like. Hence,\n\nlanguage learning and natural syntax is one of the active research\n\nareas in the field of language technology \\[12\\]. The aim of this\n\npaper is to introduce the basic concepts of genetic algorithms and\n\noptimization procedure. An attempt has been made to briefly\n\ndescribe the mathematical foundation, encoding techniques,\n\nselection strategy, genetic operators, issues, and many more\n\nconcepts related to GAs. Further, to show the working of GAs, a\n\ncase study for grammar induction has been undertaken from the\n\ntraining data (S+ and S-). For the context free grammar (CFG)\n\ninduction from the training data, an algorithm has been designed\n\nand implemented in a GA environment. Section-2 explains the\n\nstandard genetic algorithms. Section-3 introduces the\n\nmathematical foundations for a GA. This section covers the\n\nschema theory and its criticism. The basic terms and techniques\n\nhave been mentioned in section-4. The aim of including this\n\nsection is to introduce various encoding techniques, selection\n\ntechniques and genetic operators, as well as outline the\n\ndifferences between GAs and other conventional optimization\n\ntechniques and justify the reasons for using GA. It also explains\n\nthe difficulties one may face during the implementation of GA. A\n\ncase study for grammar induction is given in section-5. This\n\nsection gives a detailed description of the context free grammar\n\ninduction.

A Standard Genetic\n\nAlgorithm (SGA) may contain the following \\[1\\]: chromosomes,\n\ngenes, a fitness function, crossover, mutation and selection.\n\nGenetic algorithms always start with a set of solutions represented\n\nby chromosomes, called population.\n\nA chromosome cis a mathematical object that may be\n\nrecognized as a string of symbols or matrices with real or integer\n\nentries, or a graph with evaluated vertices and edges. Suppose,\n\nCis a finite set composed of all possible chromosomes that may\n\nbe constructed. Hence, the chromosome specification rules are\n\nclassified as:\n\n\uf07b\n\n\uf07d\n\n' '' '''\n\n, ,,,........Ccccc\uf03d (1)\n\nIf \uf0c2is the set of real numbers, then an objective function\n\n:fC\uf0ae\uf0c2is used to assign to each chromosome cC\n\n\uf0ce\n\na\n\nreal number ()\n\nf\n\nc. We will look for the global minimum over\n\nthe set C as:\n\narg min()\n\nopt cC\n\ncFc\n\n\uf0ce\n\n\uf03d (2)\n\nIn SGA, the role of the objective function is to provide a\n\nrepresentation of the environment in which the chromosomes\n\nevolve following Darwinian evolution \\[13\\]. The aim of the\n\nevolution is to construct chromosomes that are closely related to\n\nan optimal chromosome opt\n\nc as given in equation (2).\n\nTo perform an SGA, one has to use mutation and crossover\n\noperators \\[1\\]. If Mois a mutation operator then\n\n:\n\no\n\nM\n\nCC\uf0ae, that assigns stochastically to each chromosome\n\ncC\uf0cea new chromosome as: '()\n\no\n\ncMcC\uf03d\uf0ce.\n\nSimilarly, a crossover operator can be shown\n\nas 22\n\n:\n\no\n\nCC C\uf0ae, where o\n\nCis the crossover operator.\n\nCrossover operator assigns stochastically to a pair, such\n\nas 12\n\n,cc C\uf0ce , to a new pair''\n\n12 12\n\n(, )(, )\n\no\n\nccC cc\uf03d.\n\nMutation and crossover operators are unified in an operator called\n\nreproduction operator. Let o\n\nR\n\nbe the reproduction operator. Then\n\n22\n\n:\n\no\n\nR\n\nCC\uf0aeis determined as follows:\n\n''\n\n12 12\n\n12 12\n\n'\n\n11\n\n'\n\n22\n\n(, )(, )\n\n(, )(, )\n\n()\n\n()\n\no\n\no\n\no\n\no\n\ncc Rcc\n\nccC cc\n\ncMc\n\ncMc\n\n\uf0fc\n\n\uf03d\uf0ef\n\n\uf03d\uf0ef\n\n\uf0fd\n\n\uf03d\uf0ef\n\n\uf0ef\n\n\uf03d\uf0fe\n\n\uf025\uf025\n\n\uf025\n\n\uf025\n\n(3)\n\nHence, equation (3) clearly shows that, in the first stage of\n\nreproduction, crossover is performed, and then the resulting\n\nchromosomes are muted.\n\nA stochastic decision as to whether the operators o\n\nM\n\nand\n\no\n\nCwill be applied or not, is completely based on two\n\nprobabilities, namely prob\n\nMand prob\n\nCrespectively.

Diagrammatical Representation of Genetic\n\nAlgorithms (GAs)\n\n3.MATHEMATICAL FOUNDATION OF\n\nGAs\n\nThis section will propound the mathematical foundation theory of\n\nGAs. Many researchers have tried to assess the behavior of GAs\n\nmathematically. Holland \\[1\\] presented a GA based on the Schema\n\nTheory. However, the Schema Theory was criticized by Fogel\n\n(1962) who tried to model GAs with Markov Chains \\[15\\]. To gain\n\na deeper understanding of GAs, therefore, let us take a closer look\n\nat the key concepts of schema theory as well as its criticism.\n\n3.1 Schema Theory\n\n3.1.1 Schema\n\nSchema theory is useful for the analysis of Genetic Algorithms.\n\nUsing schema, we can categorize points into different parts of the\n\nsearch space. It is a string that contains \u20180\u2019, \u20181\u2019 and a \u2018don\u2019t care\u2019,\n\nrepresented as \u2018\\*\u2019 \\[1\\]. For example, the set of the schema \u20180\\*\\*1 is\n\n{0001, 0011, 0101, 0111}.\n\n3.1.2 Defining Length\n\nIt is the distance between the outermost none \u2018\\*\u2019 bits \\[16\\]. For\n\nexample, the gene \u2018\\*0\\*1\\*10\\*\u2019 has a defining length of 5.\n\n3.1.3 Order of Schema\n\nIt is defined as the total number of none \u2018\\*\u2019 bits, present in the\n\ngene \\[16\\]. For example the order of \u2018\\*0\\*1\\*10\\*\u2019 is 4.\n\n3.1.4 Schema Theorem\n\n\u201cShort, low-order, above-average schemata receive exponentially\n\nincreasing trials in subsequent generations of genetic algorithm\n\n\\[17\\].\u201d\n\nAssumptions,\n\n(,)\n\nM\n\nSt : Number of strings matched by schema S in tth\n\ngeneration\n\nL: Length of the chromosome\n\nd\n\nL: Defining length of schema S\n\nS\n\nO: Order of Schema S\n\n(,)\n\nf\n\nSt :\n\nFitness value of schema S defined as the\n\naverage fitness of all strings in the population\n\nmatched by schema S.\n\n()Ft : Average number of occurrences of S\n\nc\n\nP: Probability of One point crossover\n\nm\n\nP: Probability of mutation\n\nTaking the effects of the proportionate selection of reproduction\n\ninto account, a reproductive schema growth equation is obtained\n\nand represented as follows \\[1\\]:\n\n(,)\n\n(,1)(,)1( )\n\n() 1\n\nd\n\ncSm\n\nL\n\nfSt\n\nM\n\nStMStPO P\n\nFt L\n\n\uf0e9\uf0f9\n\n\uf02b\uf0b3\uf02d \uf02d\n\n\uf0ea\uf0fa\n\n\uf02d\n\n\uf0eb\uf0fb\n\n(7)\n\nThe derivation of equation (7) can be found in \\[17\\].\n\n3.1.5 Criticisms of the Schema Theorem\n\nThe main criticism of the Schema theory is that it neglects the\n\nconstructive behaviour of crossover and mutation. In addition, it\n\ndoes not answer questions, such as convergence rate, size of\n\npopulation, and many more. The author of \\[18\\] argues that the\n\nschema theorem converges on the schema that are local winners\n\nrather than the winners of an actual competition with the best\n\nobserved fitness values. Therefore, this theorem is not good\n\nenough to estimate the proportion of schema in the case of\n\nproportionate selection, used in the presence of noise \\[19\\].\n\nHowever, the author of \\[20\\] defends the schema theorem and\n\nargues that the criticism given in \\[19\\] is not based on the original\n\ntheorem. Besides, the original theorem behaves very well in the\n\npresence of noise. In the same vein, \\[21\\] affirms that the criticism\n\nis not of the original schema theorem, but its over interpretation.\n\n4\\. BASIC STRUCTURING GAs\n\nSince Genetic Algorithm techniques neither follow any\n\ndifferential equations, nor work like a continuous function, one\n\ncan only structure a GA for practical applications as an optimizer.\n\nHowever, there are many limitations encountered with the\n\nstandard GA. Many practical problems have been noticed in\n\nwhich the structure of the GA had to be altered to suit the needs.\n\nThere have been several operational changes introduced into the\n\nchromosome representations, operators and implementation. The\n\nfollowing are a set of operations recommended for an appropriate\n\nstructuring of the GA to suit the requirements.\n\n4.1 Encoding Techniques in GAs\n\nGenetic Algorithms support problem specific encoding techniques\n\nto transform the problem solution into chromosome. A variety of\n\nencoding techniques are used in GAs, such as binary encoding,\n\nvalue encoding, tree encoding, etc.\n\n4.1.1 Binary Encoding\n\nIt is the most basic technique used by many researchers (Figure\n\n2). It is so popular because of its simplicity and traceability. It\n\ngives many possible chromosomes with a small number of alleles\n\n\\[2\\].\n\n265\n\nFigure 2. Binary Encoding Technique\n\n4.1.2 Value Encoding\n\nIt is suitable for the problems in which values, such as real\n\nnumbers, are used. In order to represent chromosomes, it uses\n\nsequences of values, like real numbers, characters or objects\n\n(Figure 3).\n\nFigure 3. Value Encoding Technique\n\nTypically, value encoding is used for some specific problems in\n\nwhich a new type of reproduction operator is required.\n\n4.1.3 Permutation Encoding\n\nIn this technique, each chromosome can be represented as a string\n\nof numbers, representing a position in a sequence (Figure 4).\n\nFigure 4. Permutation Encoding Technique\n\nIt is best suited for ordering problems, such as travelling salesman\n\nor task scheduling problems.\n\n4.1.4 Tree Encoding\n\nIn order to evolve programmes or expressions, we can use tree\n\nencoding technique (Figure 5). In this technique we can represent\n\neach chromosome as a tree of some objects, functions or\n\ncommands.\n\nFigure 5. Tree Encoding Technique\n\n4.2 Selection Techniques\n\nSelection techniques play an important role in generating good\n\noffspring. Depending on the problem, a variety of selection\n\nmethods have been proposed and implemented \\[22\\]. Figure 6\n\nshows the traditional and alternative techniques, used for selection\n\nin GAs.\n\nFigure 6. Various Selection Techniques Used for GAs\n\n4.3 Genetic Algorithm Operators\n\nGAs support two basic operators, viz. crossover and mutation. To\n\noptimize the solution, selection of the relevant operator is very\n\nimportant. The selection of crossover and mutation operators\n\ndepends on the encoding techniques and the needs of the problem.\n\nAuthors of \\[2\\] have given a detailed description of the GAs\u2019\n\noperators (Figure 7).\n\nFigure 7. Crossover and Mutation Operators Used in GAs\n\n4.3 GA vs. Conventional Optimization\n\nGenetic Algorithm is a special type of optimization technique\n\nwhich differs from the conventional optimization in many ways\n\n\\[23\\]:\n\n\uf0b7GAs operate with coded versions of the problem parameters,\n\nrather than parameters themselves, i.e., GAs work with the\n\ncoding of the solution set and not with the solution itself.\n\n\uf0b7Genetic Algorithms always work on the whole population\u2019s\n\nsolutions, while a conventional optimization technique\n\nsearches the solution from a single point. This feature of GA\n\nhelps in avoiding local stationary points, and provides a\n\npathway to reach the global optimum.\n\n\uf0b7Fitness is a measure of the GA\u2019s performance, rather than\n\nderivation. However, the important thing for using GA is to\n\nidentify the correct and meaningful decoding function.\n\n\uf0b7GAs use probabilistic transition operates, while the\n\nconventional methods for continuous optimization apply\n\ndeterministic transition operates, i.e., GAs do not use\n\ndeterministic rules.\n\n4.4 Why is GA used?\n\nGenetic Algorithms have many advantages, and therefore have\n\nattracted many researchers. In this section, we list some of these\n\nadvantages:\n\n266\n\n\uf0b7Easy to understand and use, with less mathematical concepts.\n\n\uf0b7Using GAs, one can address multi-objective problems.\n\n\uf0b7One can easily apply the problem constraints by\n\nincorporating them in the form of chromosomes.\n\n\uf0b7Authors of \\[24\\] aver that it is independent of the error\n\nsurface.\n\n\uf0b7GAs can solve multimodal, non-differentiable, non-\n\ncontinuous problems \\[24\\].\n\n\uf0b7They are also suitable to address a variety of NP-complete\n\nproblems \\[24\\].\n\n4.5 Issues with GAs\n\nWe have listed many advantages of GAs in section 4.4. However,\n\nthey still have some problems. During the study of GAs, we came\n\nacross three phenomena (Figure 8) that affect the working of\n\nGAs. A detailed description of these phenomena can be seen in\n\n\\[16\\].\n\nFigure 8. Difficulties with Genetic Algorithms\n\n5.CASE STUDY: Grammar Induction\n\nAll the languages and automata have been divided into four\n\nclasses, from the least powerful (type3) to the most powerful\n\n(type 0). Type2 grammars, i.e., Context Free Grammars or\n\nlanguages have their own importance in the field of computer\n\nscience and other fields. Context Free Grammar (CFG) can be\n\nused to represent high level procedural languages, such as C and\n\nPascal, which can be parsed by using Deterministic Push Down\n\nAutomata (D-PDA) \\[25\\].\n\n5.1Grammar Induction\n\nGrammar induction is the technique of learning grammar from\n\ncorpora. There are varieties of algorithms given for learning\n\nregular languages. The process of inductive learning involves\n\ngeneralization from the training data. The objective is learning\n\nformal languages, such as those of the Chomsky hierarchy from\n\nsample strings.\n\nWyard \\[26\\] shows the effect of different grammar representations.\n\nIn the experimental results of \\[26\\], an evolutionary algorithm\n\nusing standard Context Free Grammar (Bakus Naur Form (BNF))\n\noutperformed other representations. In the formal language\n\ntheory, a context-free grammar (CFG) is a grammar in which\n\nevery production rule is of the form \\[27\\]:\n\n\uf061\n\n\uf062\n\n\uf0ae (8)\n\nWhere,\n\n\uf061\n\n= single non-terminal symbol, and \u03b2 = a string of\n\nterminals and/or non-terminals (possibly empty). The term\n\n\u201ccontext-free\u201d implies that non-terminals can be rewritten without\n\nregard to the context.\n\nText learning is the process of learning from a set of positive\n\nsamples, while learning from the negative examples is called\n\ninformant learning. The author of \\[27\\] argues that a language\n\nacceptor can be used for the learning process which will accept\n\nthe elements of S\n\n\uf02b\n\nand reject the elements ofS\n\n\uf02d\n\n. The present\n\ncase study addresses the problem of finding CFGs from a set of\n\nS\n\n\uf02b\n\nand S\n\n\uf02d\n\n.\n\nGuy De Pauw \\[28\\] contends that the field of evolutionary\n\ncomputing comprises problem-solving techniques to find\n\nsolutions to particular problems by applying recombination and\n\nmutation to the individual in a society of possible solutions.\n\n5.2Implementation Methodology\n\nFor the case study, a genetic algorithm was designed and\n\nimplemented with a sub-section of the intermediated population\n\nusing recombination operators separately, and was then merged\n\nwith the original population to get the population for the next\n\ngeneration.\n\n5.2.1 Chromosome Structure for CFG Induction\n\nFor structuring the chromosomes, we used the sequential\n\nchromosome structuring \\[29\\] \\[30\\]. To structure a chromosome,\n\nwe used binary encoding techniques. The decoding process was\n\nbased on the simple mapping of random chromosomes, based on\n\nbit sequences.\n\nSuppose V= set of non-terminals, \\*\n\n\uf053= set of terminals, and\n\n\uf042\n\n= set of 3-bit/4-bit binary equivalents for non-terminals and\n\nterminals. Then the process of mapping can be represented as a\n\nmathematical function.\n\n:\n\nf\n\nVB\uf0ae And \\*\n\n:\n\nf\n\nB\uf053\uf0ae  (9)\n\n:hB V\uf0ae And \\*\n\n:hB\uf0ae\uf053  (10)\n\nWhere his the function used to map the sequential blocks of 0\u2019s\n\nand 1\u2019s to terminals or non-terminals.\n\nEquation (9) and (10) were used for coding and decoding\n\nrespectively. In this scheme, 3-bit/4-bit representations were used\n\nin which \u201c111\u201d and \u201c1111\u201d were taken as \u201cepsilon\u201d. For the\n\nimplementation of the present system, we used a 3-bit\n\nrepresentation if the number of terminals in the language was less\n\nthan 4, along with 4 non-terminals.\n\nAs Table 1 shows, there were two terminals used in the language\n\nhaving the bit representations \u201c100\u201d and \u201c101\u201d respectively. The\n\nother bit representations in the terminal were used to represent\n\nnull or epsilon.\n\nSuppose we have a chromosome (length =120) as:\n\n01010100011010001000000000001000101101000111101001111\n\n11100100001000101101000111111001101110111101001111000\n\n00000111101111\n\nPartitioning the chromosome in 3-bit representation:\n\n010\\|101\\|000\\|110\\|100\\|010\\|000\\|000\\|000\\|010\\|001\\|011\\|010\\|001\\|111\\|01\n\n0\\|011\\|111\\|110\\|010\\|000\\|100\\|010\\|110\\|100\\|011\\|111\\|100\\|110\\|111\\|011\\|1\n\n10\\|100\\|111\\|100\\|000\\|000\\|111\\|101\\|111\\|\n\nTable 1.

Selection of the chromosome for the next generation\n\nwas treated as a separate operator.\n\nA crossover is a randomly set exploitation operator. There are\n\nvarious crossover techniques discussed in \\[2\\]. Typically, in GA\n\nevolution, the operation rate lies between 0.6 and 1.0 as the\n\nprobability of crossover \\[16\\].\n\nThe crossover operator is an exploitation operator; hence, it\n\ncannot generate a different offspring. Therefore, we used a\n\nmutation operator to search new areas, in contrast to the crossover\n\nas many varieties of the mutation operator were present \\[2\\]. The\n\ntypical value of mutation was less than 0.1 for the standard GA\n\n\\[16\\].\n\nFigure 9 shows the recombination operators (crossover, mutation)\n\nused in the present work.\n\nFigure (a). Crossover Operator\n\nFigure (b). Mutation Operator\n\n\\*P1, P2: Parents, OS: offspring, RM: Random Mask, # inverts the\n\nbit if random mask is 1.\n\nFigure 9. Recombination Operator for Genetic Algorithm\n\nFor the CFG induction using GA, we used the bit masking\n\noriented data structure for a better performance of the mutation\n\noperator \\[31\\]. Bit masking can be done in two steps, namely\n\ncrossover and mutation \\[31\\]. For the grammar induction, a variant\n\nof the crossover operator was used, and for mutation, a random\n\nmask with the similar probability of reversal of each bit in the\n\nchosen chromosome was taken. The proportionate intermediate\n\npopulations were generated separately using the reproduction\n\noperators. During the reproduction process, due to the random\n\nnature of the mask, we could achieve better performance.\n\n5.2.3 Objective/Fitness Function and Fitness Value\n\nThe objective function or fitness function provides a binding\n\nbetween the GA and the system. It is the basis for evaluating the\n\nperformance of each chromosome. The objective function can be\n\nrescaled as a fitness function to maintain uniformity over various\n\nproblem domains \\[17\\] \\[3\\]. The authors of \\[16\\] have presented\n\nseveral methods of structuring the objective function.\n\nTo evaluate the performance of the chromosome for the present\n\ncase study (language learning), a fitness function was used in\n\nwhich the fitness of the individual chromosomes increases for\n\nevery accepted positive sample ( S\uf02b) and every rejected negative\n\nsample (S\n\n\uf02d\n\n). The value of the fitness function decreases for\n\nevery accepted negative sample or for every rejected positive\n\nsample. The best grammar will be the grammar which accepts all\n\nthe positive samples with a minimum number of rules \\[32\\].\n\n5.2.4 Selection Technique\n\nThe process of finding trials for any particular individual used in\n\nthe reproduction process is known as Selection \\[35\\]. There are\n\nthree methods \\[33\\] to measure the performance of selection\n\ntechniques: bias, spread and efficiency.

Using MLDP, we generated the corpus of\n\nS\uf02band S\uf02d. The valid strings generated during this procedure\n\nwere considered positive strings, while the others were considered\n\nnegative strings. The correctness of the generated strings was\n\ntested with the best known grammar available. The results-set was\n\ngenerated in the form of table (Table 4) with the fitness value.\n\nSince genetic algorithms have a deterministic nature, to get\n\ncorrect and most effective results, we took the fitness value after\n\nten runs. The fitness value shown in Table 4 is based on the\n\nacceptance and rejection of the corpora ofS\n\n\uf02b\n\nand\n\nS\uf02drespectively.

It\n\nbriefly covers the ideas about the schema theorem and the\n\ncriticism of the theorem. The authors have tried to describe the\n\nbasic terms of genetic algorithms, such as operators, encoding\n\nmechanism, and selection techniques used to formulate the\n\nproblem according to the requirements. The theme is to encourage\n\nresearchers, engineers and academicians, especially beginners,\n\nwho may have little or no knowledge of GA.\n\nThe case study has been provided to show how to implement a\n\nproblem in a genetic algorithmic environment. An algorithm for\n\nthe grammar induction (CFG induction) has been implemented,\n\nand found to be working successfully. The sample set used for the\n\ncase study was limited in accordance with MLDP \\[32\\]. For the\n\ncase study, we selected a light weight grammar example, but there\n\nis an ample scope to apply the same method to complex grammar\n\nexamples. The results show the tendency to incline towards the\n\nlocal optimum convergence which requires special attention in\n\nfuture work. The authors have tried to provide sufficient and\n\nrelevant material to encourage interest of the beginners to use GA\n\nto solve their practical problems.\n\nFigure 10.

Using coordinate data from 30 fracture surface feature points, the traditional GA and modified AGA methods were compared, with the mean value of the normalized Mahalanobis distance indicating the reliability of the results. The study found that the modified AGA approach with UDEC had a significantly smaller mean value of normalized Mahalanobis distance than the traditional GA approach, demonstrating its higher accuracy and reliability in analyzing the fracture surface feature points of the rocky slope. Additionally, the research found that the location of the fracture surface of the anticline rocky slope is closely related to the inhomogeneous bulk density caused by weathering. These findings contribute to sustainability efforts by improving our understanding of the behavior of rocky slopes, informing better land management and infrastructure planning, and reducing uncertainties in predicting the behavior of rocky slopes for more sustainable infrastructure development and land management practices.\n\n[View](publication/370455557_Improved_Fracture_Surface_Analysis_of_Anticline_Rocky_Slopes_Using_a_Modified_AGA_Approach_Feasibility_and_Effectiveness_Evaluation)\n\nShow abstract\n\n[Application of the Improved JAYA Algorithm in Searching the Worst Mistuning Patterns for the Splittered Impeller](publication/382016154_Application_of_the_Improved_JAYA_Algorithm_in_Searching_the_Worst_Mistuning_Patterns_for_the_Splittered_Impeller)\n\nChapter\n\n- Jul 2024\n\n- [Kaicheng Liu](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Kaicheng-Liu-2286285227)\n- [Zhaoyu Liu](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Zhaoyu-Liu-2286280444)\n- [Yingliang Yan](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Yingliang-Yan-2286260667)\n\n[View](publication/382016154_Application_of_the_Improved_JAYA_Algorithm_in_Searching_the_Worst_Mistuning_Patterns_for_the_Splittered_Impeller)\n\n[Performance analysis of genetic algorithm for grammatical inference](publication/357852775_Performance_analysis_of_genetic_algorithm_for_grammatical_inference)\n\nChapter\n\n- Jan 2022\n\n- [![Hari Mohan Pandey](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAADUlEQVR42mN89OjNfwAJDwOxHEacwgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)Hari Mohan Pandey](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hari-Pandey)\n\nThe performance of the genetic algorithm for grammatical inference is presented in this chapter. The chapter offers implementation details of algorithms that were explained in Chapter 4. Extensive computer simulations are performed to validate the performance. The Taguchi method is incorporated for parameter tuning, which makes the algorithms more robust, statistically sound, and quickly convergent. Algorithms are effectively applied to context-free languages as well as regular languages of varying complexity. The computational results are collected and analyzed. The results show that both of the proposed algorithms are able to find an optimal or close to optimal grammar with the best fitness and can also determine results in less time. Boolean operators introduced diversity in the population, which helps explore the search space adequately. The performance of the algorithms is tested against other global optimization algorithms and against algorithms implemented for grammatical inference. Statistical tests are performed to determine the performance significance of the algorithms.\n\n[View](publication/357852775_Performance_analysis_of_genetic_algorithm_for_grammatical_inference)\n\nShow abstract\n\n[State of the art](publication/357852643_State_of_the_art)\n\nChapter\n\n- Jan 2022\n\n- [![Hari Mohan Pandey](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAADUlEQVR42mN89OjNfwAJDwOxHEacwgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)Hari Mohan Pandey](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hari-Pandey)\n\nGenetic algorithms (GAs) are one of the most popular types of nature-inspired algorithms. GAs have been successfully implemented in a wide range of applications across domains such as optimization, bioinformatics, pattern recognition, image processing, and economics. The fitness function is used to measure the quality of the solution in GAs. Typically, the particular value for each gene begins to dominate as the search evolves. During the evolutionary search, fitness decreases as the population converges. This leads to the problems of premature convergence and slow finishing. In this chapter, a detailed and comprehensive review of different approaches implemented to prevent premature convergence, as well as their strengths and weaknesses, are presented. This chapter also discusses factors affecting performance during the search for global optima and brief details about the theoretical framework of the GA. A detailed summary and analysis of reviewed literature are provided for quick review. Existing premature convergence handling algorithms are compared by considering various factors. The main motivation for presenting this comparison is to identify new strategies to develop more powerful algorithms to prevent premature convergence.\n\n[View](publication/357852643_State_of_the_art)\n\nShow abstract\n\n[State of the art](publication/357852641_State_of_the_art)\n\nChapter\n\n- Jan 2022\n\n- [![Hari Mohan Pandey](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAADUlEQVR42mN89OjNfwAJDwOxHEacwgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)Hari Mohan Pandey](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hari-Pandey)\n\nThis chapter presents a comprehensive discussion on the state of the-art of grammatical inference (GI). The fundamental definitions of language and grammar are explained in a simplified manner for beginners and intermediate-level researchers. The first part of Chapter 2 is dedicated to basic grammar definitions. The discussion starts with the standard grammar presentation referred as Backus\u2013Naur form. After that, standard grammar representation is discussed along with the Chomsky hierarchy. Various grammar representations such as unstructured grammar, context sensitive grammar, context-free grammar, and regular grammar are covered. Other forms of grammar such as matrix grammar, random context-free grammar, valence grammar, and bag context grammar are explained using the rewriting mechanism. Learning algorithms, with their strengths and weakness, are presented later in the chapter. Finally, a comparative classification of different learning algorithms is presented. The key concepts presented in this chapter are a detailed and comprehensive review of approaches that have been proposed for GI, with the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. The approaches are classified based on the various factors. The analysis of each approach is conducted and presented in tabulated form for quick review.\n\n[View](publication/357852641_State_of_the_art)\n\nShow abstract\n\n[Genetic algorithms and grammatical inference](publication/357839654_Genetic_algorithms_and_grammatical_inference)\n\nChapter\n\n- Jan 2022\n\n- [![Hari Mohan Pandey](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAADUlEQVR42mN89OjNfwAJDwOxHEacwgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)Hari Mohan Pandey](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hari-Pandey)\n\nThis chapter presents an algorithm for grammatical inference using the genetic algorithm.

In Genetic Algorithms (GAs) this is achieved through proportionate selection of individuals and reproduction operators. GAs can suffer premature convergence, when the diversity of the population decreases over time and search gets trapped in a local optimum, returning a very poor quality solution. Mask-fill reproduction operators utilizes bit-masking oriented data structure (BMODS) that maintains a good ratio between exploration and exploitation. Mask-fill reproduction operators have been utilised in various applications, but the exploration and exploitation ability of mask-fill reproduction operators have not been compared against other reproduction operators. This paper describes a rigorous and practical statistical methodology for the exploratory analysis of the mask-fill reproduction operators. First, the issues of robust experimental design and setting the control parameters for implementing a GA is addressed. Second, the impact of various reproduction operator combinations are analysed. In this study, three crossover operators and five mutation operators are considered which creates fifteen crossover-mutation operator combinations. Third, the methodology is demonstrated by considering grammatical inference (GI) problem as domain of inquiry. A hybrid genetic algorithm integrated with Sequitur algorithm (GAWS) is proposed for GI. Numerical results are presented to describe the effect of crossover-mutation operator combinations. The performance of the proposed GAWS is compared against the state-of-the-art algorithms. Statistical test are conducted to determine the performance significance of both crossover-mutation operator combinations and the proposed GAWS algorithm.\n\n[View](publication/348423066_Statistical_exploratory_analysis_of_mask-fill_reproduction_operators_of_Genetic_Algorithms)\n\nShow abstract\n\n[Secure medical data transmission using a fusion of bit mask oriented genetic algorithm, encryption and steganography](publication/341060432_Secure_medical_data_transmission_using_a_fusion_of_bit_mask_oriented_genetic_algorithm_encryption_and_steganography)\n\nArticle\n\n- Apr 2020\n- FUTURE GENER COMP SY\n\n- [![Hari Mohan Pandey](data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAADUlEQVR42mN89OjNfwAJDwOxHEacwgAAAABJRU5ErkJggg==)Hari Mohan Pandey](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hari-Pandey)\n\nThis paper presents a bit mask oriented genetic algorithm based secure medical data transmission mechanism.

Literature reveals that it can avoid premature convergence \u2013 a situation when optimization algorithms get stuck at local optimum. BOMGA utilizes Boolean based mask-fill operators and performs reproduction operations in two different phases that helps to avoid premature convergence. Cryptographic features are integrated with the BMOGA for secure data transmission. The encrypted data is embedded into the medical images through 1-level and 2-level Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). The reverse process of the BMOGA is implemented for the extraction of secret message from the encrypted one. Numerical experiments are conducted to determine the performance of the proposed algorithm. Results reveals that the proposed algorithm is capable of secure data transmission. Performance comparison is done with the state-of-the-art algorithm with respect to the datasets. Comparative results indicated the superiority of the proposed algorithm in terms of various statistical measures such as peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR), correlation, structural content (SC), structure similarity (SSIM) and mean square error (MSE) to report the results.\n\n[View](publication/341060432_Secure_medical_data_transmission_using_a_fusion_of_bit_mask_oriented_genetic_algorithm_encryption_and_steganography)\n\nShow abstract\n\n[Path tracking control for a robot-trailer system in the presence of measurement bias](publication/334235400_Path_tracking_control_for_a_robot-trailer_system_in_the_presence_of_measurement_bias)\n\nConference Paper\n\n- Feb 2019\n\n- [Tong Wu](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Tong-Wu-2127699070)\n- [John Y.

It generates solutions to optimization problems using techniques inspired by natural evolution, such as inheritance, mutation, selection, and crossover. Genetic algorithms are one of the best ways to solve a problem for which little is known. They are a very general algorithm and so work well in any search space. All you need to know is what you need the solution to be able to do well, and a genetic algorithm will be able to create a high quality solution.\n\n[View](publication/283361244_Genetic_Algorithm_-_an_Approach_to_Solve_Global_Optimization_Problems)\n\nShow abstract\n\n[4\\.

This chapter presents a case analysis undertaken to find the shortest path from Los Angeles that leads to San Francisco, Seattle, Las Vegas, Phoenix, San Diego, and then returns to Los Angeles. The usual way to find the shortest path is to evaluate the distance of each path and then choose the shortest one.. This process is called enumeration, and it is appropriate when the possibilities are low. This chapter finally explains the problem of evolving neural networks to solve complex problems.\n\n[View](publication/344937199_4_Evolutionary_Computation)\n\nShow abstract\n\n[The Origin of Species](publication/320182358_The_Origin_of_Species)\n\nBook\n\n- Jan 1998\n\n- [Charles Darwin](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Charles-Darwin-2133564676)\n\n[View](publication/320182358_The_Origin_of_Species)\n\n[Adaptation in natural and artificial systems](publication/313706874_Adaptation_in_natural_and_artificial_systems)\n\nArticle\n\n- Jan 1994\n\n- [J.H.

(1) The first level are GAs, where the chromosome fitness is determined exactly by the chromosome position on the fitness landscape. This first level of sophistication corresponds to standard GAs, where chromosomes are directly mapped on positive real numbers. (2) In the second level the chromosome fitness is determined by the nearest neighborhood of the chromosome position on the fitness landscape, i.e. chromosomes are capable of learning. The role of learning in evolution theory called the Baldwin effect was first studied by GAs in 1987 by Hinton and Nowlan. (3) In the third level the chromosome fitness is determined not only by the nearest neighborhood of the chromosome position on the fitness landscape but also by the so-called meme that determines an information that is able to increase the fitness of chromosomes. The idea of memes was introduced to evolutionary biology by Dawkins. The concept of chromosome is enlarged to a complex of chromosome and meme, both of them determine a fitness of chromosomes itself. All the above three different levels of GAs may be formally considered as evolutionary steps of Darwin's evolution. The purpose of this communication is to present a GA simulation of learning and Dawkins' memes.\n\n[View](publication/268418555_Simulation_of_Baldwin_effect_and_Dawkins_memes_by_genetic_algorithm)\n\nShow abstract\n\n[Parallel Models for Evolutionary Algorithms](publication/265271975_Parallel_Models_for_Evolutionary_Algorithms)\n\nArticle\n\n- [Adrian Grajdeanu](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Adrian-Grajdeanu-2019319416)\n\nPresentation Plan 3 Bethke (1976) in his study he describes a (global) parallel implementation of a conventional GA and of a GA with a generation gap (i.e., it only replaces a portion of its population in every generation) Grosso (1985) proposed an implementation of a serial simulation for a concurrent formulation Tanese (1987), Pettey et al (1987) are two of the earliest parallel implementations. The population of a GA was broken into a relatively small number of sub-populations and each processing element in the architecture was assigned an entire sub-population and executed a rather standard GA. Then Cohoon et al (1987) shows that the punctuated equilibria theory of natural systems transfers to parallel implementations of EAs and leads to bursts of evolutionary progress. Gordon et al (1992) and Adamidis (1994) consecrated the term of island model parallel GA.\n\n[View](publication/265271975_Parallel_Models_for_Evolutionary_Algorithms)\n\nShow abstract\n\n[A review of selection methods in genetic algorithm](publication/265078034_A_review_of_selection_methods_in_genetic_algorithm)\n\nArticle\n\n- Jan 2011\n\n- [R.

It is used to improve the chances of the survival of the fittest individuals. There are many traditional selection mechanisms used and many user specified selection mechanisms specific to the problem definition.

One can establish communication via two medium first oral communications (Speech Processing) and second is written (Text Processing). This project focuses the second medium (text processing) of communication where we communicate using any language by writing some thing. Genetic Algorithms are developed as random search methods, which have not so sensitivity on primary data of the problems. It can be used in estimation of system parameter to get the best possible solution. Genetic Algorithms have been discussed for grammar induction. Grammar Inference or Language Learning is the process of learning grammar from training data. This paper mainly discussed the various methods for learning context-free grammar (CFG) from the corpus of string and presents the approach of informant learning in the form of result for two standard grammar problems first balanced parenthesis problem and second two symbol palindrome over {a, b}.\n\n[View](publication/261432899_Context_free_grammar_induction_library_using_Genetic_Algorithms)\n\nShow abstract\n\nShow more",
